# [Philement](https://www.philement.com)

While Klipper has been an enormous boon to the 3D printing community as a whole, it isn't without its faults. Philement has been conceived as a full-on replacement, but it will take quite awhile to get there. In the interim it may end up serving as a front-end to Klipper, a bit like Obico perhaps.

The main differentiator to address upfront is that a large chunk of the lower-level code has been written in C and specifically not Python. For so many reasons. To help make this go a little more quickly, various AI engines are being tasked to help out. It isn't written by AI, but written with the help of AI. If that distinction matters to anyone. If nothing else, this gives a degree of plausible deniability if there's something crazy going on in the code.

As for the name, it is a combination of terms like 'Phi' (referencing the number 500 among *many* other meanings), 'filament' (that's what 3D printing is primarily obsessed with), and 'element' (small pieces of something larger). The individual components of the project have been named after atomic elements, for example.

As far as progress reporting goes, well, there are likely 500 steps or more to be completed before anyone takes this project seriously. Some of those steps will yield useful tools, as is already the case. But it is an ambitious project with many items to complete, and many more that likely haven't even been conceived of yet.

## Elements

This project has a number of, well, elements. Each is named after an element in the periodic table. Like elements in the real world, some of these will be hugely important while others may be relatively insignificant. Some will require thousands and thousands of developer hours, and others not so much. And the effort applied to each will likely be equally unbalanced as the focus shifts among the different pieces needed to get this up and running. The main [Philement Documentation](/docs/README.md) index is also available, covering elements that are a little further along.

## Additional Notes

While this project is currently under active development, feel free to give it a try and post any issues you encounter.  Or start a discussion if you would like to help steer the project in a particular direction.  Early days yet, so a good time to have your voice heard.  As the project unfolds, additional resources will be made available, including platform binaries, more documentation, demos, and so on.
