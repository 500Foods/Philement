As with most UIs these days, this will ultimately end up as an HTML/CSS/JS app, likely a PWA app. How we get there might not be all that popular. But we're interested in getting there, not in being popular with every dev crowd. So this will likely be a TMS WEB Core project. Which will not be a surprise to anyone who has looked at other repositories by this developer.

## Brainstorming
- Something that could be packaged up and deployed directly alongside hydrogen and helium.
- Primarily talks directly to hydrogen via a websocket interface.
- The usual 'responsive' approach applies.
- Will likely have many JavaScript dependencies. Tabulator. D3. Bootstrap. Etc.
- Considerable thought given to authentication.
- Considerable thought given to cloud-basaed options.
- Considerable thought given to internationalization.
- Replicate what Mainsail/Fluidd/Obico/etc. are doing as bare minimum.
- Should be able to connect to multiple hydrogen instances.
- Users range from home user to enterprise farms.
- Performant, or at least as performant as web apps can be.
- Should work consistently whether hydrogen is running or not.
- Optionally connect to helium for reporting tasks.
- Possibly, anyway. Trying to stick to one interface where possible.
- Themable. And more than light/dark.
- Dashboards.
- D3 Charts. Exportable.
- Tabulator. Everything exportable. Importable where it makes sense.
- Interface to hydrogen configuration.
- Interface to helium SQL.
- Interface to Lua, wherever that happens to live.
