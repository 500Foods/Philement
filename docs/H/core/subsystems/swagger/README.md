# Swagger Subsystem

The Swagger subsystem is the interactive documentation system that provides a user-friendly web interface for exploring and testing the system's API capabilities, making complex technical features accessible to everyone.

It serves embedded Swagger UI files that allow users to view API documentation in a browser, try out API endpoints, and understand how to interact with the system's services.

This subsystem enables developers and users to easily discover and test the available APIs without needing to write code or use external tools.
