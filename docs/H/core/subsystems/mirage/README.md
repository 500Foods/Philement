# Mirage Subsystem

## What is the Mirage Subsystem?

The Mirage subsystem is the distributed proxy network that enables secure and seamless remote access to Hydrogen servers. It acts as a bridge between public access points and private Hydrogen instances, allowing users to connect to their devices from anywhere in the world while preserving all customizations, branding, and features.

## Why is it Important?

Mirage makes remote device management simple and secure. Whether you're monitoring industrial equipment, accessing home automation systems, or managing remote servers, Mirage ensures that you get the exact same experience as if you were directly connected locally. It supports multiple devices through a single infrastructure, scales to handle thousands of connections, and maintains complete security through encrypted tunnels and proper authentication.
