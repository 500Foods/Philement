# Terminal Subsystem

The Terminal subsystem is Hydrogen's web-based command-line interface that provides secure, remote access to the system's shell through your web browser. It allows users to execute commands, manage files, and perform system administration tasks without requiring direct physical access to the server.

This subsystem is essential for remote system management, enabling administrators and users to interact with the Hydrogen server from anywhere with an internet connection, while maintaining security through authentication and authorization controls.

The terminal interface supports full shell functionality, including interactive commands, scripting, and real-time output, making it a powerful tool for system monitoring, troubleshooting, and configuration.
