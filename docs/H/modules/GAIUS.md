# GAIUS Module

The [GAIUS](https://www.gaiusmodel.com) project is implemented using Hydrogen.

It extends Hydrogen primarily by adding new REST API endpoints which are registered with the webserver subsystem, and by extension with Swagger. Additoinal commands are registered with the websocket subsystem for real-time interactions.

A separate database migration for GAIUS is included as part of the [Helium](https://github.com/500Foods/Philement/tree/main/elements/002-helium) project.
