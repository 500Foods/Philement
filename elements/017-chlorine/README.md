# www.philements.com
This is the source code for the www.philements.com website.

This has been created with TMS WEB Core, a tool that transpiles Delphi code into 100% HTML/CSS/JS, and is the same tool used for lithium. 

## Brainstorming
- Just a website to direct people to Philement resources, like GitHub or the various elements.
- GitHub is largely for technical users or developers, website is for printer owners or users that just want to try it out.
- Will be the gateway to login to a cloud-based Philements service
- Will likely incorporate a TMS XData server (REST API) at some point to implement the cloud back end.
- NOTE: TMS WEB Core is not a free product. Nor is Delphi of course.
- Will likely use other JavaScript libraries when and as needed, which will be documented here.
