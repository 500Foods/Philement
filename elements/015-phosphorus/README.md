# phosphorus - Printer Experiment: Beltless Printer Design
Modern 3D printers are infused with an assortment of belts, like those controlling the flying gantry in the Voron 2.4r2. Other printers use a leadscrew design like the Voron Trident. But there are other options to explore that might yield interesting designs. 
For example, a rack-and-pinion driven design might have an advantage in terms of much larger print volumes and more 3D-printable parts. This project is about exploring some of these other designs.

## Brainstorming
- Rack and pinion with herringbone gears for each axis, stretched out as long as needed.
- More powerful motion system designed to also support CNC routing at the same time
- "Coffee table" design, where the rack and pinion is laid out on a coffee table as the print bed.
- Wiring embedded along the track for power, CAN bus, maybe even filament
- Build in blocks, printed in blocks, easy to make larger or smaller with no substantial cost premium
- Non-conventional print volumes, intended for larger prints, larger diameter nozzles, etc.
- More environmental sensors to detect surrounding motion, virtual fences, etc.
- Toolhead changer - 3D printer toolheads with different filaments, CNC routers with different bits
