# Carbon - Example 1
In this example, a single run of the carbon app using two very similar images is performed. The images are taken only a few seconds apart, so the only real difference is in the digital displays on the left. These are images captured by the Klipper Timelapse module at their original native resolution of 2592x1944 from a common 4K webcam.
