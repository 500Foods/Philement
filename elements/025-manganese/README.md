Lua is a great scripting language, perfect for embedding inside of Hydrogen. This is actually what it was designed for - embeddeing in other applications. 

It is a bit light on supporting libraries though. Python has a richer ecosystem to play in, certainly, but that comes at a cost - like multi-GB imports?! Not sure who thought that was a good idea. And being embedded in C, Lua has virtually no startup costs and a dramatically reduced
footprint overall. This is particularly important when running on modest hardware, or coincidentally also when you want to run *many* instances inside of a Kubernetes cluster. We want both.

To help out with the limited library support, we've got a bunch here that might not rise to the level of something to share via luarocks, etc. but that are useful for our project and perhaps others.

Other support libraries may find their way here as well. Think jinja2 support for Lua, or other bits and pieces that don't particularly belong anywhere else, but that we want to integrate with Lua somewhere.
