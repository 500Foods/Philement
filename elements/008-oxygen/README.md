Roughly coinciding with the arrival of smartphones, notifications have become a big deal. And, like everything else, standards dictate that everyone uses something different for notifications. 

## Brainstorming
- Sending out notifications via the obvious candidates - email, SMS, and so on.
- Notification management tools.
- Logging.
- Sending photos when a problem is detected.
- Sending links that can direct the person to the problem.
- Browser notifications if anyone insists.
- Maybe include the "maintenance system" as a part of this, as that's really all it is.
