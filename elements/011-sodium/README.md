For 3D printing to really catch on, full-color is likely going to be where it is at. But there are a few hurdles along the way. Currently, MMUs are where things are at.

## Brainstorming
- Have a closer look at how the Bambu AMS works, 8 Track project, etc.
- Plan is to design something like a filament drybox that is modular (yes, like 8 Track).
- Better plan is to make the set of boxes able to feed more than one printer.
- Add an extruder to the box.
- Add a "load" feature to spool in filament in addition to spool swap.
- Figure out filament cutting.
- Consider a load cell for weight tracking.
- Wire them up with CAN bus.
- Power them with a 24V/5V common power supply.
- Add in the same device for nitrogen in each box, minus the WiFi.
- 5-pin cable from each box to a "controller box".
- Figure out what to do about filament routing.
