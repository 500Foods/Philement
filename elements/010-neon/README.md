# neon
Lighting has a number of interesting implications. This is focused primarily on what can be done with neo pixels. Maybe lots and lots of neopixels.

## Brainstorming.
- General printer lighting options.
- Set of nepixel patterns for different printing conditions.
- Should be able to look at a printer from afar and tell how much time is left.
- Integrate something with multiple printers.
- Maybe a string of lights can be turned into a status display.
- Other lights, like toolhead lights or MMU lights.
- Lights about other status elements - MCU temps and so on.
- Remote lights.
