# nitro
This is a C program that takes a couple of parameters and then starts up a websocket server and advertises it over mDNS. 

There are lots of bits and pieces here that make up the core of both hydrogen and lithium projects, potentially others as well.

This is a prototype really, test that it works, doesn't crash, no memory leaks, that sort of thing. And then use it in
other projects by basically duplicating this work or whatever pieces are needed.
