                    This public query returns the list if icons used throughout the app. The idea here
                    is to allow a degree of customization or theming at the icon level, allowing overrides
                    for specific icons, or adjustments to icon sizes, rotation, etc.

                    ## Parameters

                    - None.

                    ## Returns

                    - `key_idx`: The key index of the icon.
                    - `value_txt`: The name of the icon.
                    - `collection`: Details about the icon.

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}lookups`: The lookups table

                    ## Notes

                    This is intended to be a public query, meaning that we should cache it so
                    that it doesn't unduly impact the database performance. As icons don't
                    change often, we can cache it typically for the duration of the server's
                    running time. We should make a note to add this to whatever trigger
                    mechanism we end up implementing, so that it gets reloaded when it changes.
