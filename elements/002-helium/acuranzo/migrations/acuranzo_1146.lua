                    This public query returns the enabled themes (CSS) from the lookups table.

                    ## Parameters

                    - None.

                    ## Returns

                    - `key_idx`: The key index of the theme.
                    - `value_txt`: The name of the theme.
                    - `sort_seq`: The sort sequence of the theme.
                    - `code`: The CSS code of the theme.

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}lookups`: The lookups table

                    ## Notes

                    This is intended to be a public query, meaning that we should cache it so
                    that it doesn't unduly impact the database performance. As themes don't
                    change often, we can cache it typically for the duration of the server's
                    running time. We should make a note to add this to whatever trigger
                    mechanism we end up implementing, so that it gets reloaded when it changes.
