-- Migration: acuranzo_1094.lua
-- QueryRef #003 - Get IP Blacklist

-- luacheck: no max line length
-- luacheck: no unused args

-- CHANGELOG
-- 1.0.0 - 2025-12-28 - Initial creation

-- Note: Migrations populating the query table are more than a little bit confusing!
--       It is the most-indented SQL code that is the actual query being created.
--       In this case, this is the query starting at column 21, after FOUR selects.
--       The rest is just the migration code, which is inserting into the same table,
--       so a lot of what we have here is being duplicated. Pay close attention to the
--       query_type_a28 field and also query_queue_a58 to ensure that the new query
--       is populated with the appropriate values.

                    Determine whether a given IP address is present in the blacklist. The blacklist
                    is updated whenever repeated failed login attempts are detected from an IP address.

                    ## Parameters

                    - `IPADDRESS` (string): The IP address to check against the blacklist.

                    ## Returns

                    - `list_value` (string): The blacklisted IP address if found.

                    ## Tables

                    - `app.lists`: Contains blacklist entries with validity periods (list_type_a31 = 0).
