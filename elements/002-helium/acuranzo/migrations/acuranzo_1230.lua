                    Reschedules an outbound mail queue row for a future retry
                    after a transient failure, recording the last attempt's
                    SMTP reply and releasing the instance/claim lock.

                    ## Parameters

                    - `QUEUE_ID` (integer, required): Queue row to reschedule.
                    - `NEXT_ATTEMPT_AT` (timestamp, required): Scheduled time
                      for the next attempt.
                    - `SMTP_CODE` (integer, required): Last SMTP reply code.
                    - `SMTP_TEXT` (string, required): Last SMTP reply text.
                    - `SERVER_INDEX` (smallint, required): Index of the server
                      used for the failed attempt.

                    ## Returns

                    - No result rows.

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}mail_queue` (migration 1218).

                    ## Security Notes

                    - `query_type_a28` is `${TYPE_INTERNAL_SQL}` (0) so this query
                      is not reachable via the REST API.
