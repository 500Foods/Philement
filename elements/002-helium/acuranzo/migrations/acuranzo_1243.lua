                    Retrieves the active OTP row for a given email and
                    purpose. Multiple active rows should not normally exist;
                    the result is ordered newest-first.

                    ## Parameters

                    - `EMAIL` (string, required): Address the OTP was sent to.
                    - `PURPOSE_A66` (smallint, required): OTP purpose from
                      Lookup 066.

                    ## Returns

                    - All columns from `${SCHEMA}mail_otp_codes` for the
                      matching active OTP.

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}mail_otp_codes` (migration 1221).

                    ## Security Notes

                    - `query_type_a28` is `${TYPE_INTERNAL_SQL}` (0) so this query
                      is not reachable via the REST API.
