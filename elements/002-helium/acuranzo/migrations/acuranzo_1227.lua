                    Claims a pending outbound mail queue row by setting its
                    status to `sending`, recording the owning instance and a
                    claim token, and incrementing the attempt counter.

                    ## Parameters

                    - `QUEUE_ID` (integer, required): Queue row to claim.
                    - `INSTANCE_ID` (string, required): Owning Hydrogen instance.
                    - `CLAIM_TOKEN` (string, required): Random token held during
                      the send attempt.

                    ## Returns

                    - No result rows. The caller checks affected-row count to
                      detect a lost race.

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}mail_queue` (migration 1218).

                    ## Security Notes

                    - `query_type_a28` is `${TYPE_INTERNAL_SQL}` (0) so this query
                      is not reachable via the REST API.
