                    Returns the next pending outbound mail queue row that is
                    due for delivery. The caller is responsible for atomically
                    marking the row `sending` via QueryRef #097.

                    ## Parameters

                    - None.

                    ## Returns

                    - All columns from `${SCHEMA}mail_queue` for the highest-
                      priority due row.

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}mail_queue` (migration 1218).

                    ## Security Notes

                    - `query_type_a28` is `${TYPE_INTERNAL_SQL}` (0) so this query
                      is not reachable via the REST API.
                    - This is intentionally a plain `SELECT` rather than an
                      atomic claim, because engine-specific `UPDATE ...
                      RETURNING` syntax differs between PostgreSQL, MySQL,
                      SQLite, and DB2. Atomic claiming will be handled by the
                      C repository helper using QueryRef #097.
