# Lithium Linting Exclusions

# SUMMARY: This configuration excludes several file types from linting:
# - Build directories (debug, release, perf, valgrind builds)
# - Test artifacts (logs, results, diagnostics)
# - Test configuration with deliberate error (for testing error handling)
#
# Used by test_99_codebase.sh for documentation quality checks.

# This file contains patterns for files to exclude from linting checks.
# Each line should contain one pattern. Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Patterns use bash glob syntax (same as .gitignore).

# Build directories (these are also excluded by default in the test script)
# A 'make clean' is also done in the codebase test prior to running lints
build/*

# LICENSE.md isn't really a markdown file but plain text 
LICENSE.md

# Node.js dependencies - these are third-party code and shouldn't be linted
