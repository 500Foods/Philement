# Lithium Testing Framework

This folder contains the comprehensive testing framework for the Lithium PWA SPA client.
It includes test scripts, configuration files, support utilities, and detailed documentation for validating the functionality, performance, and reliability of the Lithium web app.
This framework was copied from the Hydrogen project and adjusted to suit the Lithium project.
