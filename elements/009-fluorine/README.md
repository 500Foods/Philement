# fluorine
Everybody has a ton of filament. Maybe this could be managed better.

## Brainstorming
- Look more closely at other filament management systems.
- General interface for inventory-keeping. What was purchased when, etc.
- Pair with Klipper, etc. for deducting from inventory automatically.
- Prompt during filament changes.
- Cost accounting.
- Print history by filament type.
- Filament recycling issues.
