This is the website source code for x3dp.com. 
- A TMS WEB Core project for the front-end
- A hydrogen server as the backend REST API server
- A Postgres database to store everything

## Brainstorming
- Intended as an Exchange/marketplace for the 3D Printing Community
- Troodon (and WelcomeToTroodon) as the first wave of users to test it out
- Printers, parts, prints, plastics, and products are the intended items for trade
- Not intending to serve as a financial intermediary but rather just a matching service
- Some integration with Discord for quick user signup and authentication
