# Hydrogen Linting Exclusions
# This file contains patterns for files to exclude from linting checks.
# Each line should contain one pattern. Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Patterns use bash glob syntax (same as .gitignore).
#
# Examples:
# *.min.js        # Exclude all minified JavaScript files
# vendor/*        # Exclude everything in the vendor directory
# test_*.json     # Exclude test JSON files
# !test_api.json  # Re-include a specific test JSON file

# Build directories (these are also excluded by default in the test script)
build/*
build_debug/*
build_perf/*
build_release/*
build_valgrind/*

# Test artifacts
tests/logs/*
tests/results/*
tests/diagnostics/*
tests/config*

# Generated files
src/config/config/*.inc

# Example of excluding specific files that might need special handling
src/config/config_defaults.c
src/config/config_env.c
