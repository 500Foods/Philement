# Hydrogen Linting Exclusions

# SUMMARY: This configuration excludes several file types from linting:
# - Build directories (debug, release, perf, valgrind builds)
# - Test artifacts (logs, results, diagnostics)
# - Test configuration with deliberate error (for testing error handling)
# - C snippet includes for JSON handling that aren't meant to be linted independently
#
# Used by test_99_codebase.sh for documentation quality checks.

# This file contains patterns for files to exclude from linting checks.
# Each line should contain one pattern. Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Patterns use bash glob syntax (same as .gitignore).

# Build directories (these are also excluded by default in the test script)
# A 'make clean' is also done in the codebase test prior to running lints

# Configuration files for testing have one that deliberately has an 
# error - to test the error-handling code at startup - so we exclude it here.
# Note that there is a test that specifically checks for this error, so
# if this is removed, that test will fail. As a fnunny side note, AI tools
# like to correct the error in the file whenever they get a chance!
