# Hydrogen Linting Exclusions

# This file contains patterns for files to exclude from linting checks.
# Each line should contain one pattern. Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Patterns use bash glob syntax (same as .gitignore).

# Build directories (these are also excluded by default in the test script)
# A 'make clean' is also done in the codebase test prior to running lints

# Configuration files for testing have one that deliberately has an 
# error - to test the error-handling code at startup - so we exclude it here.
# Note that there is a test that specifically checks for this error, so
# if this is removed, that test will fail. As a fnunny side note, AI tools
# like to correct the error in the file whenever they get a chance!

# The project contains C files that are snippet includes - not something that
# can reallistically be linted on their own. Just standard jansson JSON though.
