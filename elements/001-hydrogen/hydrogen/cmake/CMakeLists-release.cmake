# Release Build Configuration for Hydrogen
#
# This file contains the release build configuration with special optimizations,
# UPX compression, and payload embedding.
#
# Usage:
# cmake --build . --target hydrogen_release  : Build stripped, compressed executable
# cmake --build . --target all_variants      : Build all variants including release
#
# Release build with special optimizations, UPX compression, and payload embedding
# This matches the original Makefile 'make release' behavior exactly

# Clean executables target (used by release)

    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E remove -f ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../hydrogen_release
