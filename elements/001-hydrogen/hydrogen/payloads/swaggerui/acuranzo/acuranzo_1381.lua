-- CHANGELOG
-- 1.0.1 - 2026-09-16 - Match QueryRef #127/#017: TABLE=queries, TYPE_SQL, :ROLEID bind, reverse deletes the QueryRef from queries.
-- 1.0.0 - 2026-09-09 - Initial creation. QueryRef #155 resolves a role_id to its name for Course Manager authz (L3).

                    from the `roles` table.

                    ## Parameters

                    - `ROLEID` (integer, required): The `role_id` to resolve.

                    ## Returns

                    - `role_id` (integer): The role ID.
                    - `name` (string): The role name (e.g. `staff`, `admin`).

                    ## Tables

                    - `${SCHEMA}roles` (migration 1016).

                    ## Security Notes

                    - `query_type_a28` is `TYPE_SQL` (1) so JWT-bearing clients
                      can call this via `auth_query`. Internal SQL (type 0) is
                      blocked on that endpoint.
