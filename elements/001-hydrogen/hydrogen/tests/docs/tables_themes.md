# Tables Themes Library Documentation

## Overview

The `tables_themes.sh` library provides utilities for managing visual themes and styling options for table structures within the Hydrogen test suite. This script is part of the modularized support system designed to standardize and simplify table-related operations across test scripts.

## Purpose

This library focuses on defining and applying different visual themes or styles to tables, ensuring consistent appearance in test outputs or logs. It aims to provide reusable functions to apply themes to tables across various test scenarios.

## Available Functions

Below are the key functions provided by `tables_themes.sh`. These functions can be sourced and called within test scripts to apply table themes effectively.

- **Function Name: TBD**
  - **Description**: (To be detailed once functions are extracted or defined during migration.)
  - **Usage**: `source tables_themes.sh && function_name [arguments]`
  - **Parameters**: (To be specified.)
  - **Return Value**: (To be specified.)
  - **Example**: (To be provided.)

*Note*: Specific functions and their detailed documentation will be added as part of the migration process when the script's contents are fully analyzed and modularized.

## How to Use

To use the theme management functions from this library in a test script:

1. Source the script: `source lib/tables_themes.sh`
2. Call the desired function or access theme definitions as needed.

*Note*: Detailed usage examples will be updated during the migration process to reflect the actual implementation.

## Additional Notes

- This documentation is a placeholder and will be updated with specific function details as the migration of support scripts to the 'lib/' directory progresses.
- Feedback on the structure or specific theme preferences is welcome during the review process to ensure this library meets the needs of the test suite.
