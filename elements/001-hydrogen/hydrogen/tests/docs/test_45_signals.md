# Test 45 Signals Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_45_signals.sh` script is a signal handling test tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating the server's response to various system signals.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server handles system signals appropriately, performing actions such as clean shutdown or configuration reload as expected. It is essential for verifying the server's robustness and proper behavior under different signal conditions.

## Key Features

- **Signal Response Testing**: Tests response to multiple system signals:
  - **SIGINT**: Triggers a clean shutdown.
  - **SIGTERM**: Triggers a clean shutdown.
  - **SIGHUP**: Triggers a restart with config reload.
  - **Multiple Signal Handling**: Ensures proper handling when multiple signals are received.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_45_signals.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for ensuring that the server can handle external interruptions and configuration changes gracefully, which is critical for operational stability.
- Feedback on the structure or additional signals to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
