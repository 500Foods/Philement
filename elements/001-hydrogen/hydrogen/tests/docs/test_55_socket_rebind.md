# Test 55 Socket Rebind Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_55_socket_rebind.sh` script is a network testing tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating the handling of socket binding and port reuse, especially after unclean shutdowns.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server can properly manage socket binding and reuse ports, preventing issues when restarting after an unclean shutdown. It is essential for verifying the server's network stability and recovery capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Socket Binding Testing**: Tests proper handling of socket binding operations.
- **Port Reuse Validation**: Ensures the server can reuse ports after an unclean shutdown, avoiding conflicts or failures due to lingering socket states.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_55_socket_rebind.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for ensuring network reliability, especially in scenarios where the server might restart unexpectedly or after a crash.
- Feedback on the structure or additional socket scenarios to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
