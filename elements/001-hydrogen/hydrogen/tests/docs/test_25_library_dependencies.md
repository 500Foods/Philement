# Test 25 Library Dependencies Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_25_library_dependencies.sh` script is a validation tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on verifying the presence and correct versions of all required library dependencies.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server has access to all necessary libraries at the correct versions, preventing runtime issues due to missing or incompatible dependencies. It is crucial for confirming the environment setup before comprehensive testing.

## Key Features

- **Dependency Verification**: Checks for the presence of all required library dependencies.
- **Version Validation**: Ensures that the installed versions of libraries match the expected versions for compatibility with Hydrogen.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_25_library_dependencies.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for validating the test environment and should be run early in the test sequence to ensure that subsequent tests are not affected by dependency issues.
- Feedback on the structure or additional dependencies to verify is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
