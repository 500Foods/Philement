# Test 10 Compilation Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_10_compilation.sh` script is a build verification tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on ensuring that all components of the Hydrogen project compile without errors or warnings.

## Purpose

This script validates the build process for the Hydrogen server and related components, ensuring that the codebase is in a compilable state before further testing. It is a prerequisite for other tests and is run first by `test_00_all.sh`.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Compilation Testing**: Tests compilation of the main Hydrogen project in all build variants (standard, debug, valgrind).
- **OIDC Client Examples**: Tests compilation of OIDC client examples.
- **Strict Compiler Flags**: Treats warnings as errors using flags like `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Werror`, and `-pedantic`.
- **Detailed Logging**: Creates detailed build logs in the `./results` directory for review.
- **Fast Failure**: Fails immediately if any component fails to compile, preventing further testing on an unstable build.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_10_compilation.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is critical as it ensures the integrity of the build process and is a gatekeeper for subsequent tests in the suite.
- If this test fails, `test_00_all.sh` will skip remaining tests to avoid misleading results from an uncompilable codebase.
- Feedback on the structure or additional build variants to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
