# test_91_code_size.md

## Overview

The `test_91_code_size.sh` script analyzes code size metrics and file distribution across the Hydrogen project to track codebase growth and maintain quality standards.

## Purpose

This test provides codebase analysis by:

- Counting lines of code across different file types
- Analyzing distribution of code vs. documentation vs. configuration
- Tracking project complexity and size metrics
- Generating reports for project maintenance and planning
- Identifying areas with high code density for review

## Analysis Categories

### Code Metrics

- **Line Counting**: Total lines, code lines, comment lines, blank lines
- **File Distribution**: Breakdown by file type (C, Shell, Markdown, JSON, etc.)
- **Language Analysis**: Metrics per programming language used
- **Documentation Ratio**: Code-to-documentation ratios
- **Size Trends**: Historical growth tracking

## Tools Used

- **CLOC (Count Lines of Code)**: Primary tool for code analysis
- **Custom Scripts**: Additional analysis for project-specific patterns
- **File Type Detection**: Automatic classification of source files

## Metrics Reported

- Total lines of code across all file types
- Lines per programming language
- Comment density and documentation coverage
- File count and average file size
- Distribution of functional vs. test vs. documentation code

## Expected Outcomes

- **Pass**: Analysis completed successfully, metrics within expected ranges
- **Info**: Detailed breakdown of codebase composition and size
- **Trends**: Comparison with previous runs if historical data available

## Integration

This test is part of the static analysis suite (90+ range) and provides valuable metrics for project management and code review processes.
