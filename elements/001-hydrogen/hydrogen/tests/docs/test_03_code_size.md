# Test 03 Code Size Analysis Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_03_code_size.sh` script performs comprehensive code size analysis including source code analysis, line counting, large file detection, code line count analysis with cloc, and file count summary.

## Purpose

This test analyzes the codebase to ensure no files exceed line limits, detects large non-source files, provides code metrics using cloc, and summarizes file distributions. It helps maintain code quality and organization.

## Key Features

- Analyzes source files excluding lintignore patterns
- Categorizes files by line count bins
- Detects files exceeding max lines (1000)
- Finds large non-source files (>25k)
- Runs cloc for detailed code metrics
- Summarizes file types and counts
