# Test 60 API Prefixes Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_60_api_prefixes.sh` script is an API testing tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating API routing with different URL prefixes and configurations.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server correctly handles API requests with various URL prefixes, maintaining proper routing and response behavior. It is essential for verifying the server's API accessibility and configuration flexibility.

## Key Features

- **API Routing Testing**: Tests API routing functionality with different URL prefixes.
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensures proper response behavior under various prefix configurations.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_60_api_prefixes.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for ensuring that API endpoints remain accessible and functional regardless of URL prefix configurations, which is critical for API usability and integration.
- Feedback on the structure or additional prefix scenarios to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
