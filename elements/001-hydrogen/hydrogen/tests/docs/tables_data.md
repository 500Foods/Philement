# Tables Data Library Documentation

## Overview

The `tables_data.sh` library provides utilities for managing and manipulating data within table structures for the Hydrogen test suite. This script is part of the modularized support system designed to standardize and simplify table-related operations across test scripts.

## Purpose

This library focuses on handling data content for tables, such as generating sample data, formatting data entries, or validating data integrity within tables. It aims to provide reusable functions to manage table data consistently across different test scenarios.

## Available Functions

Below are the key functions provided by `tables_data.sh`. These functions can be sourced and called within test scripts to manage table data effectively.

- **Function Name: TBD**
  - **Description**: (To be detailed once functions are extracted or defined during migration.)
  - **Usage**: `source tables_data.sh && function_name [arguments]`
  - **Parameters**: (To be specified.)
  - **Return Value**: (To be specified.)
  - **Example**: (To be provided.)

*Note*: Specific functions and their detailed documentation will be added as part of the migration process when the script's contents are fully analyzed and modularized.

## How to Use

To use the data management functions from this library in a test script:

1. Source the script: `source lib/tables_data.sh`
2. Call the desired function or access data management utilities as needed.

*Note*: Detailed usage examples will be updated during the migration process to reflect the actual implementation.

## Additional Notes

- This documentation is a placeholder and will be updated with specific function details as the migration of support scripts to the 'lib/' directory progresses.
- Feedback on the structure or specific data handling needs is welcome during the review process to ensure this library meets the requirements of the test suite.
