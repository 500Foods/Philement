# Test 20 Shutdown Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_20_shutdown.sh` script is a specialized test tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating the shutdown behavior of the Hydrogen server.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server terminates cleanly, releasing all resources and processes properly during shutdown. It is essential for verifying the server's ability to handle termination without leaving residual issues.

## Key Features

- **Shutdown Behavior Testing**: Tests proper shutdown behavior to ensure resources are released and processes terminate cleanly.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_20_shutdown.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test focuses on the shutdown phase of the server lifecycle, complementing other lifecycle tests like `test_15_startup_shutdown.sh`.
- Feedback on the structure or additional shutdown scenarios to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
