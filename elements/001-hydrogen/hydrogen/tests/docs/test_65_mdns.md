# Test 65 System Endpoints Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_65_system_endpoints.sh` script is a system testing tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating system endpoints functionality.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server correctly exposes and handles system endpoints, which are critical for system monitoring and management. It is essential for verifying the server's operational status and integration with system-level functionalities.

## Key Features

- **System Endpoints Testing**: Tests the availability and correctness of system endpoints.
- **Status Monitoring**: Validates the server's ability to report system status through endpoints.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_65_system_endpoints.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for ensuring that system endpoints are accessible and provide accurate information, which is crucial for system administration and monitoring.
- Feedback on the structure or additional endpoint scenarios to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
