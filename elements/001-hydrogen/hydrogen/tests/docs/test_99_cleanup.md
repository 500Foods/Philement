# test_99_cleanup.md

## Overview

The `test_99_cleanup.sh` script performs comprehensive cleanup of build artifacts, temporary files, and test outputs to ensure a clean development environment.

## Purpose

This test maintains project hygiene by:

- Removing build artifacts and temporary files
- Cleaning up test output directories
- Clearing log files and diagnostic data
- Resetting the workspace to a clean state
- Preparing for fresh test runs or builds

## Cleanup Categories

### Build System Cleanup

- **Build Artifacts**: Removes compiled binaries, object files, and build directories
- **CMake Files**: Cleans CMake cache and generated files
- **Temporary Files**: Removes editor backups, swap files, and system temporaries
- **Log Files**: Clears test logs and diagnostic outputs
- **Result Archives**: Removes old test result files

## Directories Cleaned

The cleanup process targets:

- `build/` - CMake build directory
- `tests/logs/` - Test execution logs
- `tests/results/` - Test result files
- `tests/diagnostics/` - Diagnostic output
- Temporary files throughout the project

## Safety Features

- **Selective Removal**: Only removes known safe-to-delete files and patterns
- **Preservation**: Keeps source code, documentation, and configuration files
- **Verification**: Confirms file types before deletion
- **Logging**: Reports what was cleaned for verification

## Expected Outcomes

- **Pass**: Cleanup completed successfully, workspace is clean
- **Fail**: Cleanup encountered errors or was unable to remove files
- **Info**: Reports on files and directories cleaned

## Integration

This test typically runs as the final step in the test suite (test_99) to clean up after all other tests have completed.
