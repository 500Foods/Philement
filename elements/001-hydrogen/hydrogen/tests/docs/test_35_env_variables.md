# Test 35 Environment Variables Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_35_env_variables.sh` script is a configuration testing tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating the handling of environment variables and their impact on server behavior.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server correctly processes and applies environment variables, which are critical for configuring server behavior and runtime settings. It is essential for verifying that configuration through environment variables functions as expected.

## Key Features

- **Environment Variable Handling**: Tests how environment variables are interpreted and applied to server configuration.
- **Behavioral Impact**: Validates the impact of environment variables on server operations and runtime behavior.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_35_env_variables.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for ensuring that environment-based configuration mechanisms work correctly, which is crucial for deployment flexibility.
- Feedback on the structure or additional environment variables to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
