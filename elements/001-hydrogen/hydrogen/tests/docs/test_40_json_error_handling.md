# Test 40 JSON Error Handling Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_40_json_error_handling.sh` script is a configuration testing tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on validating the handling of malformed JSON configurations and error reporting.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server can gracefully handle errors in JSON configuration files, providing appropriate error messages and preventing crashes or undefined behavior due to invalid input. It is essential for verifying the robustness of configuration parsing.

## Key Features

- **Malformed JSON Testing**: Tests the server's response to invalid or malformed JSON configurations.
- **Error Reporting Validation**: Ensures that error messages are clear, accurate, and helpful for diagnosing configuration issues.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_40_json_error_handling.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is important for ensuring that the server remains stable and provides useful feedback when faced with configuration errors, which is critical for user experience and debugging.
- Feedback on the structure or additional error scenarios to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
