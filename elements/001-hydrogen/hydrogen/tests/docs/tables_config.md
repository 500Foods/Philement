# Tables Config Library Documentation

## Overview

The `tables_config.sh` library provides configuration settings and utilities for managing table structures within the Hydrogen test suite. This script is part of the modularized support system designed to standardize and simplify table-related operations across test scripts.

## Purpose

This library centralizes configuration parameters for tables, such as default sizes, styles, or formatting options, allowing test scripts to maintain consistency in how tables are defined and utilized. It aims to reduce redundancy by providing a single source of configuration truth for table-related functionalities.

## Available Functions

Below are the key functions provided by `tables_config.sh`. These functions can be sourced and called within test scripts to access predefined table configurations.

- **Function Name: TBD**
  - **Description**: (To be detailed once functions are extracted or defined during migration.)
  - **Usage**: `source tables_config.sh && function_name [arguments]`
  - **Parameters**: (To be specified.)
  - **Return Value**: (To be specified.)
  - **Example**: (To be provided.)

*Note*: Specific functions and their detailed documentation will be added as part of the migration process when the script's contents are fully analyzed and modularized.

## How to Use

To use the configurations or functions from this library in a test script:

1. Source the script: `source lib/tables_config.sh`
2. Call the desired function or access configuration variables as needed.

*Note*: Detailed usage examples will be updated during the migration process to reflect the actual implementation.

## Additional Notes

- This documentation is a placeholder and will be updated with specific function details as the migration of support scripts to the 'lib/' directory progresses.
- Feedback on the structure or specific configurations is welcome during the review process to ensure this library meets the needs of the test suite.
