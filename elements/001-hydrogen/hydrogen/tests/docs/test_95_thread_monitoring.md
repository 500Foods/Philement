# Test 95 Leaks Like a Sieve Script Documentation

## Overview

The `test_95_leaks_like_a_sieve.sh` script is a memory testing tool within the Hydrogen test suite, focused on detecting memory leaks in the server.

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Hydrogen server does not suffer from memory leaks, which could lead to performance degradation over time. It is essential for verifying the server's long-term stability and resource management.

## Key Features

- **Memory Leak Detection**: Tests for memory leaks during server operations.
- **Resource Analysis**: Validates the server's memory usage patterns to ensure efficient resource handling.

## Usage

To run this test as part of the full suite:

```bash
./test_00_all.sh all
```

To run this test individually:

```bash
./test_95_leaks_like_a_sieve.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- This test is critical for ensuring that the server maintains memory integrity, which is vital for long-term reliability and performance.
- Feedback on the structure or additional memory leak scenarios to test is welcome during the review process to ensure it meets the needs of the test suite.
