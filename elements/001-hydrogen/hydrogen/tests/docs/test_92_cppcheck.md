# test_92_cppcheck.md

## Overview

The `test_92_cppcheck.sh` script performs static analysis of C/C++ source code using the cppcheck tool to identify potential bugs, undefined behavior, and code quality issues.

## Purpose

This test validates code quality through static analysis by:

- Running cppcheck on all C source files in the project
- Checking for potential memory leaks, buffer overflows, and null pointer dereferences
- Identifying unused variables and functions
- Detecting potential race conditions and threading issues
- Validating coding standards compliance

## Test Categories

### Static Analysis Checks

- **Memory Issues**: Detects memory leaks, buffer overflows, and use-after-free
- **Logic Errors**: Identifies unreachable code and logical inconsistencies
- **Performance**: Highlights inefficient code patterns
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensures adherence to C coding standards

## Configuration

The test uses the `.lintignore-c` configuration file to:

- Define which checks to enable/disable
- Specify suppressions for known false positives
- Set analysis depth and coverage options

## Expected Outcomes

- **Pass**: No critical issues found in C source code
- **Fail**: Critical bugs or undefined behavior detected
- **Warning**: Minor issues that should be reviewed but don't block the build

## Integration

This test is part of the static analysis suite (90+ range) and runs automatically with `test_00_all.sh`.
