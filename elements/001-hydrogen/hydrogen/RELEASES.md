# Release Notes

<!--
EDITING GUIDELINES (not visible when rendered):
- Keep entries concise and factual
- Focus on WHAT changed, not WHY it's good
- Avoid adjectives like "comprehensive", "robust", "significant"
- Eliminate unnecessary justifications
- Use fewer words where possible
- Stick to listing actual changes, not opinions about them
- This is a technical record, not marketing material
- Use collapsible sections by month (except for the most recent month)
  - Wrap older months in <details><summary>YYYY-MMM</summary> and </details> tags
  - Keep the current/most recent month expanded
  - This creates a more compact view while maintaining all history
- Maintain consistent structure for all entries:
  - Start with a topic heading (e.g., "WebSocket Server:", "Testing:")
  - Follow with bullet points for specific changes related to that topic
  - Group related changes under the same topic
- When adding to an existing date section:
  - Consolidate entries by topic rather than repeating headers
  - Reflow content to keep all related items together
  - Example: Keep all "Documentation:" entries together, all "API:" entries together, etc.
  - Avoid patterns like "Documentation:"/items, "API:"/items, "Documentation:"/more items
