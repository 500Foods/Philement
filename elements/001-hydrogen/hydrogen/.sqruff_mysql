# Excluded rules
# LT01 - Inappropriate spacing (extra/missing/trailing whitespace)
# LT02 - Incorrect indentation / unexpected line breaks
# LT05 - Line is too long (max line length violated)
# LT06 - Function name not immediately followed by "(" (no space allowed)
# LT08 - Missing blank line after CTE closing bracket
# LT12 - File must end with a single trailing newline (and not start with blank lines)
# CP03 - Function names mus be consistently uppercase

# NOTE: CP03 was added due to issues with using brotli_decompress UDF in MySQL,
# which caused false positives due to inconsistent casing in function name usage.
