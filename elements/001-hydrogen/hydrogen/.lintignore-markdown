# .markdownlintrc - Markdown Linting Configuration
#
# SUMMARY: This configuration disables three specific markdown linting rules:

# - MD033: Allows raw HTML tags in Markdown (for advanced formatting)
# - MD047: Doesn't require newline at the end of the file
#
# Used by test_z_codebase.sh for documentation quality checks.
