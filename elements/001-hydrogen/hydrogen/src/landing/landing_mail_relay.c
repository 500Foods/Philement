/*
 * Landing Mail Relay Subsystem
 * 
 * This module handles the landing (shutdown) of the mail relay subsystem.
 * It provides functions for checking landing readiness and shutting down

 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - No subsystems depend on Mail Relay
 * 
 * Note: System is currently under development
