/*
 * Launch mDNS Client Subsystem
 * 
 * This module handles the initialization of the mDNS client subsystem.
 * It provides functions for checking readiness and launching the mDNS client.
 * 
 * The mDNS Client system enables discovery of network services:
 * 1. Discover other printers on the network
 * 2. Find available print services
 * 3. Locate network resources
 * 4. Enable auto-configuration
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - Network subsystem must be initialized and ready
 * - Logging system must be operational
 * 
 * Note: Shutdown functionality has been moved to landing/landing-mdns-client.c
