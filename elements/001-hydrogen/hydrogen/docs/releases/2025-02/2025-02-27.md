## Code Quality and Compilation

- Fixed compilation issues across OIDC components:
  - Fixed function signature mismatches in oidc_tokens.c:
    - Updated token generation functions to use OIDCTokenClaims
    - Corrected return types for token validation functions
    - Added missing parameters to ensure header/implementation consistency
  - Removed duplicate OIDCConfig definition (now in configuration.h)
  - Resolved compiler warnings by adding proper (void) casts for unused parameters
  - Fixed unused variable in websocket_server.c
  - Ensured clean builds with strict compiler flags (-Wall -Wextra -pedantic)

- Fixed OIDC client examples:
  - Corrected malformed comment structure in client_credentials.c
  - Resolved compilation errors in Client Credentials flow example
  - Ensured clean build with strict compiler flags

## OIDC Service Architecture

- Implemented new client registry system:
  - Added oidc_clients.h and oidc_clients.c for client management
  - Created client validation and authentication methods
  - Added support for client credentials

- Added full OpenID Connect Identity Provider capabilities:
  - Core OIDC service with standard endpoints (authorization, token, userinfo)
  - JWT token handling with RSA key rotation and management
  - User identity and profile management
  - Support for multiple authentication flows (authorization code, client credentials)

- Configuration Framework:
  - Extended configuration system with OIDC-specific settings
  - Added sensible defaults for all OIDC options
  - Structured validation for security parameters

- API Endpoints:
  - Added standard OIDC endpoints to API structure
  - Implemented JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint
  - Added token introspection and revocation endpoints
  - Added client registration endpoint

- Client Examples:
  - Created comprehensive client integration examples for multiple languages
  - Implemented C client examples for three OAuth flows
  - Developed a JavaScript browser-based client example
  - Created a Makefile for easy compilation of C examples

## Testing

- Added compilation verification test:
  - Created test_compilation.sh script to verify clean builds
  - Tests all build variants (standard, debug, valgrind) of main project
  - Tests OIDC client examples compilation
  - Treats warnings as errors for strict quality enforcement
  - Integrated as first step in test workflow
  - Added failure detection to skip subsequent tests if compilation fails

## Documentation

- Added developer onboarding resources:
  - Created developer_onboarding.md with visual architecture diagrams
  - Added code navigation guide with component relationships
  - Created project glossary and implementation patterns
  - Added development workflow guidance

- Created AI assistant resources:
  - Added AI_ASSISTANT.md with machine-optimized project information
  - Structured project overview in YAML format for AI processing
  - Added HTML comment in README for AI discoverability

- Enhanced OIDC-specific documentation:
  - Created comprehensive OIDC architecture documentation
  - Added code examples for client integration
  - Added explanations of token structures and security considerations
  - Updated test documentation to reflect new capabilities

- Enhanced security documentation:
  - Added security coding standards for OIDC and authentication systems
  - Provided specific guidance for JWT and token handling
  - Added best practices for cryptographic operations
  - Created standards for secure input validation
