## Build System

- Added optimized release build variant:
  - Added -O2 -s flags for performance optimization and symbol removal
  - Added -DNDEBUG flag to disable assertions in production
  - Added -march=x86-64 -flto for platform optimization and link-time optimization
  - Added -fstack-protector for additional security
  - Added version definition with -DVERSION=\"1.0.0\"
  - Integrated upx compression for reduced binary size
  - Created dedicated build directory for release artifacts
  - Added comprehensive clean target for all build variants

- Enhanced versioning system:
  - Implemented git-based versioning scheme with auto-incrementing build numbers
  - Added MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD format for consistent version identification
  - Derived BUILD number from git commit history (commit count + base offset)
  - Ensured version information is passed to all compilation steps
  - Modified startup logging to display version and release timestamp
  - Standardized version and release presentation in all logging

- Improved version management:
  - Fixed VERSION macro to support compile-time definition
  - Added #ifndef guard in configuration.h to prevent redefinition
  - Enabled version override via compiler flags
  - Maintained backward compatibility with default version

## Testing

- Enhanced test framework with release build support:
  - Modified test scripts to prioritize release build for all tests
  - Added release build as the first tested variant in compilation tests
  - Updated startup/shutdown tests to use release build when available
  - Updated system endpoint tests to prefer release build
  - Updated JSON error handling tests to use release build
  - Added automatic fallback to standard build when release not available
  - Preserved build variants between test stages for consistent testing
  - Improved test run reliability and binary availability

- Updated compilation test to fail when warnings are detected:
  - Modified test_compilation.sh to set EXIT_CODE=1 on warning detection
  - Ensures all builds, including debug build, must be warning-free
  - Maintains strict code quality standards across all build types

## Code Quality

- Improved string handling in WebSocket and utility modules:
  - Replaced unsafe strncpy usages with safer alternatives
  - Implemented explicit string truncation with proper null termination
  - Fixed format-truncation warnings in fixed-buffer string operations
  - Ensured all builds compile cleanly with Address Sanitizer enabled
  - Eliminated string handling warnings in all build types

- Improved test artifacts management:
  - Added automatic cleanup of log files before and after test runs
  - Removed stray log files from tests directory
  - Created consistent log handling across all test scripts
  - Enhanced test environment cleanliness

## Configuration

- Improved JSON error handling:
  - Added detailed JSON parsing error messages with line and column information
  - Added user-friendly error output to stderr for configuration syntax issues
  - Added graceful exit on JSON syntax errors to prevent segfaults
  - Enhanced error diagnostics to simplify troubleshooting

## API Architecture

- Restructured API modules with endpoint-specific directories:
  - Reorganized system API endpoints into dedicated subdirectories
  - Created consistent structure for all future endpoint implementations
  - Added isolated endpoint handlers with clear interfaces
  - Improved separation of concerns for API functionality

- Added new system/test diagnostic endpoint:
  - Added support for both GET and POST methods
  - Implemented JSON response with client IP address
  - Added JWT token parsing with claim extraction
  - Added proxy detection via X-Forwarded-For header
  - Added query parameter decoding into JSON array
  - Added POST data handling with URL decoding support
  - Created example endpoint for future development
