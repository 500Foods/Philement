## API

- Fixed segmentation fault in System Config endpoint:
  - Removed redundant json_decref call that was causing a double-free
  - Ensured proper JSON object lifecycle management
  - Maintained compression and response handling functionality
- Added new System Service/Config endpoint:
  - Returns server configuration file in JSON format
  - Uses api_send_json_response for automatic compression
  - Added proper Swagger documentation and annotations
  - Added to API documentation in src/api/README.md
- Refactored System Health and Info endpoints:
  - Simplified implementation using api_send_json_response
  - Standardized API response handling across all system endpoints
  - Improved code maintainability and error handling
  - Reduced code duplication by eliminating manual compression logic

## WebSocket Server

- Added configurable ExitWaitSeconds parameter:
  - Made 10-second thread exit wait timeout configurable
  - Added exit_wait_seconds field to WebSocketConfig struct
  - Modified WebSocket server to use configuration value
  - Added ExitWaitSeconds to WebSocket ConnectionTimeouts section in configuration
  - Updated documentation with parameter details
  - Set default value to 10 seconds matching previous hardcoded behavior

## Web Server

- Fixed issue with application reinitialization during Ctrl+C shutdown:
  - Added shutdown state detection to prevent restart during cleanup
  - Added guards in web server initialization components
  - Prevented payload extraction during shutdown sequence
  - Eliminated duplicate initialization messages in logs
  - Fixed shutdown race condition in component initialization

## Testing

- Enhanced system endpoint testing:
  - Added config endpoint to test_system_endpoints.sh
  - Added brotli compression verification in tests
  - Added JSON validation for configuration response
  - Added test cases for both compressed and uncompressed responses
- Updated references to old swagger path:
  - Changed "swagger/swaggerui.tar.br" to "payloads/payload.tar.br.enc" in test_compilation.sh
  - Updated .gitignore to reference new payload paths
  - Ensured consistency with existing payload directory structure

## Documentation

- Enhanced API documentation:
  - Added detailed API utility function documentation
  - Highlighted api_send_json_response for compression support
  - Improved endpoint implementation guidance

## General Improvements

- Fixed issue where server would attempt to reinitialize during shutdown
- Improved state handling in Swagger UI and payload processing
- Decoupled payload handling from Swagger UI for better reusability
- Added proper state checks to prevent reinitialization during shutdown
- Added atomic state management to prevent component reinitialization
- Added multiple state validation checks during initialization phases
- Fixed issue where components would try to reinitialize during shutdown sequence

## Swagger Integration

- Improved swagger-generate.sh for API documentation:
  - Fixed handling of endpoints that support multiple HTTP methods
  - Enhanced method-specific processing for proper OpenAPI output
  - Added better logging of detected HTTP methods
  - Improved variable separation for cleaner processing flow
