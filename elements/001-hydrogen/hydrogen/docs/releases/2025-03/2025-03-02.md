## API Documentation

- Added OpenAPI 3.1.0 integration for REST API documentation:
  - Created swagger directory at project root with generation script
  - Implemented annotation-based documentation using //@ swagger: prefix
  - Added automatic swagger.json generation from source code annotations
  - Created path, method, and response schema documentation capability
  - Added service-level organization for API endpoints
  - Implemented proper status code handling for responses
  - Added support for tagging and grouping related endpoints
  - Added example annotations for system/health endpoint
  - Generated OpenAPI-compliant output for use with standard tools
  - Completed Swagger annotations for all system endpoints (health, info, test)
  - Added comprehensive Swagger annotations for all OIDC endpoints
  - Created detailed README for swagger directory with documentation guidelines
  - Added SwaggerUI integration with download script
  - Implemented SwaggerUI packaging as optimized distributable tar file:
    - Selectively compressed static assets (JS, CSS, JSON) with Brotli for minimal size
    - Preserved dynamic files (index.html, swagger-initializer.js) for runtime modification
    - Added oauth2-redirect.html support for OAuth 2.0 authorization flows
    - Created flat file structure for efficient serving
    - Compressed final package with Brotli to ~345KB
  - Added Swagger subsystem to configuration with UI options:
    - Configurable endpoint prefix defaulting to /swagger
    - TryItEnabled, AlwaysExpanded, and other SwaggerUI configuration options
  - Added build dependencies documentation
  - Enhanced Swagger README with comprehensive implementation details

## Build System

- Added tarball identifier to release executable:
  - Appended "<<< HERE BE ME TREASURE >>>" magic string before tarball size value
  - Enables reliable detection of appended tarball in executable
  - Supports runtime determination of whether the executable includes SwaggerUI
- Enhanced build versioning system:
  - Added compile-time RELEASE timestamp using ISO8601 format:
    - Implemented in Makefile using `date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'`
    - Passed to compiler via `-DRELEASE` macro
    - Replaced runtime timestamp detection with compile-time value
    - Added fallback definitions for compatibility
  - Added BUILD_TYPE identifier for each build variant:
    - Assigned specific values for each variant (Regular, Debug, Valgrind-Compatible, Performance, Release)
    - Passed to compiler via `-DBUILD_TYPE` macro
    - Added logging of build type at startup
    - Added build_type field to system status JSON response
  - Maintained consistent compiler flags structure to prevent redefinition warnings
  - Integrated with existing version information in logs and API responses

## Configuration

- Added environment variable substitution in configuration values:
  - Implemented ${env.VARIABLE} format for referencing environment variables
  - Added automatic type conversion based on environment variable content
  - Support for null, boolean, number, and string value types
  - Fallback to defaults when environment variables don't exist
  - Consistent handling across all configuration settings
  - Added INFO-level logging under "Environment" subsystem showing variable name, type, and value
  - Implemented masking for sensitive data (keys, passwords, tokens) showing only first 5 characters
  - Enhanced testing with improved validation of environment variable processing
- Removed routine JSON processing log messages from configuration subsystem

## Initialization

- Added library dependency checking system:
  - Created utils_dependency utility module for version checking
  - Implemented runtime detection of required libraries and versions
  - Added configuration-aware dependency status reporting
  - Different log levels based on dependency status (INFO, WARN, CRITICAL)
  - Intelligent determination of required vs. optional libraries
  - Automatic detection of versions during initialization
  - Added critical dependency counting and startup reporting
  - Fixed dependency tracking logic to accurately count missing dependencies

## Testing

- Enhanced test_compilation.sh with tarball verification:
  - Added test for Swagger UI tarball presence in release builds
  - Implemented detection of "<<< HERE BE ME TREASURE >>>" delimiter
  - Added size verification to ensure executable contains the tarball
  - Integrated test into existing compilation test sequence
- Improved environment variable test script:
  - Added tracking of passed and failed checks with detailed counts
  - Added specific tests for environment variable type detection
  - Enhanced output with clear test results for each test phase
  - Fixed issues with warning/error reporting and test outcome determination
  - Added section headers to clarify different test phases
  - Fixed inconsistency where warnings didn't affect pass/fail status
  - Ensured all check failures increment failure counter properly
  - Added clearer output when environment variable logs are missing
  - Refocused tests to properly detect environment variables with more reliable pattern matching
  - Fixed handling of problematic environment variables by skipping checks where appropriate
  - Simplified regex patterns for improved reliability across different log formats
- Modified test scripts to display relative paths:
  - Added path conversion function to test_utils.sh
  - Updated command display to show relative paths instead of absolute paths
  - Modified working directory paths to use relative format
  - Updated file paths in cleanup functions to use relative paths
  - Modified log output to show only the part starting from "hydrogen/"
  - Improved log readability by removing unnecessary path prefixes
  - Fixed final result output for consistent path presentation
- Aligned library dependency test output with system test format
- Fixed process termination handling in dependency tests
