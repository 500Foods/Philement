  - Ensured correct operation when prefix is changed in configuration
  - Fixed dynamic content generation to respect configured prefix
- Made API prefix configurable in configuration file:
  - Replaced hardcoded "/api" with configurable WebConfig->api_prefix
  - Fixed format string issue in web_server_swagger.c for dynamic initializer
  - Updated API endpoint detection in web_server_request.c for consistency
  - Added helper function to build API paths with configured prefix
  - Ensured compatibility with existing API endpoints

## Testing

- Fixed test results directory path in test_system_endpoints.sh:
  - Updated script to use tests/results/ directory for output files
  - Standardized results path to match other test scripts
  - Eliminated output file scattering between project root and tests directory
- Updated upload directory paths in test configuration files:
  - Modified hydrogen_test_api.json, hydrogen_test_min.json, and hydrogen_test_max.json
  - Changed upload directories from "./uploads" to "/tmp/hydrogen_test_uploads"
  - Standardized temporary directory usage across test and production configurations
  - Prevented uploads directory creation in project root
- Refactored test scripts to use dynamic port configuration:
  - Updated test_api_prefixes.sh to extract and use port from configuration files
  - Modified test_swagger_ui.sh to use dynamically extracted port for URL construction
  - Updated test_system_endpoints.sh to use consistent base URL with correct port
  - Added port-aware socket state checking and cleanup in test_api_prefixes.sh
  - Improved handling of custom port configurations in all network-related tests
  - Fixed connection failures when using non-default ports in configuration
- Added dedicated port configurations for test isolation:
  - Created hydrogen_test_swagger_port.json with port 5060 for Swagger UI testing
  - Created hydrogen_test_system_endpoints.json with port 5070 for API endpoint testing
  - Updated test_swagger_ui.sh to use the new port-specific configuration
  - Updated test_system_endpoints.sh to use the new port-specific configuration
  - Prevented port conflicts between different test runs
  - Improved test reliability by avoiding socket rebinding issues
- Renamed Swagger test configuration files for consistency:
  - Changed to hydrogen_test_swagger_test_1.json and hydrogen_test_swagger_test_2.json
  - Updated tests/README.md with the new naming convention
  - Updated test_swagger_ui.sh to use the new configuration files
- Refactored test framework for improved modularity:
  - Removed unused support_test_runner.sh script
  - Enhanced support_utils.sh with common test functions
  - Added server management functions for test scripts
  - Created standardized test environment setup functions
  - Added HTTP request validation utilities
  - Created comprehensive test script template
  - Updated test documentation with standardized approach
  - Added step-by-step instructions for creating new tests

## Service Discovery
