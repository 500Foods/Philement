Database queue lead implementation

## Database Queue Lead Implementation

- Implemented comprehensive Lead DQM (Database Queue Manager) with conductor pattern architecture [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c]
- Added Lead queue establishment with database connection management and persistent connection handling [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:35]
- Implemented bootstrap query execution for Lead DQM with QTC (Query Table Cache) population [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:53]
- Enhanced migration system with Lead DQM orchestration, including load and apply phases with transaction safety [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:325]
- Added migration test functionality for Lead DQM with configurable test execution [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:409]
- Implemented child queue spawning for Lead DQM with support for cache, fast, medium, and slow queue types [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:452]
- Added heartbeat management for Lead DQM with connection monitoring and health checks [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:503]
- Implemented query processing for Lead DQM with incoming query handling and cleanup [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:525]
- Added comprehensive migration action determination based on available vs installed migration states [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:72]
- Implemented migration cycle execution with validation, connection locking, and error handling [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:242]
- Added child queue management with spawning and shutdown capabilities [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:563]
- Enhanced database queue infrastructure with Lead-specific function prototypes and type definitions [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.h:194-217]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for Lead DQM connection establishment and bootstrap execution [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_establish_connection.c]
- Implemented tests for Lead DQM migration execution including load and apply phases [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_run_migration.c]
- Created coverage tests for Lead DQM migration test functionality [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_run_migration_test.c]
- Added integration tests for Lead DQM process queries and heartbeat management [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_process_queries.c]
- Implemented tests for child queue spawning and management operations [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_spawn_child_queue.c]
- Added comprehensive test coverage for migration validation and action determination [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_manage_heartbeats.c]
