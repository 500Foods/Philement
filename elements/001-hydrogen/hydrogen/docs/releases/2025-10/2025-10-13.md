SQLite support, terminal websocket bridge

## SQLite Support

- Implemented comprehensive SQLite database integration with native C API bindings and connection pooling [src/database/sqlite/sqlite_driver.c]
- Added SQLite schema management with automatic table creation, migration support, and data type mapping [src/database/sqlite/schema_manager.c]
- Enhanced SQLite query execution with prepared statements, transaction support, and error handling [src/database/sqlite/query_executor.c]
- Implemented Lead SSO (SQLite Support Operator) with configuration-driven database strategies [src/database/sqlite/sqlite_handler_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical SQLite management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/database/sqlite/sqlite_handler_lead.c]
- Implemented worker SQLite tasks with database-specific tagging and performance monitoring [src/database/sqlite/create_sqlite_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for SQLite parameters and constraints [src/database/sqlite/create_sqlite_worker.c]

## Terminal WebSocket Bridge

- Implemented WebSocket-based terminal bridge with secure connection establishment and session management [src/terminal/websocket/bridge_server.c]
- Added terminal command execution with real-time output streaming and input handling [src/terminal/websocket/command_bridge.c]
- Enhanced terminal bridge with authentication, authorization, and connection multiplexing [src/terminal/websocket/session_manager.c]
- Implemented Lead TWB (Terminal WebSocket Bridge Operator) with bridge lifecycle management [src/terminal/websocket/bridge_handler_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical bridge management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/terminal/websocket/bridge_handler_lead.c]
- Implemented worker bridge tasks with terminal-specific tagging and performance monitoring [src/terminal/websocket/create_bridge_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for bridge parameters and constraints [src/terminal/websocket/create_bridge_worker.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for SQLite driver functions and schema operations [tests/unity/src/database/sqlite/sqlite_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for terminal WebSocket bridge validation and session management [tests/unity/src/terminal/websocket/bridge_test_*.c]
- Created coverage tests for Lead SSO bootstrap and SQLite strategy execution [tests/unity/src/database/sqlite/lead_test_*.c]
- Added integration tests for SQLite support and terminal WebSocket bridge pipeline [tests/integration/database/sqlite_bridge_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for Lead TWB bootstrap and bridge strategy execution [tests/unity/src/terminal/websocket/lead_test_*.c]
