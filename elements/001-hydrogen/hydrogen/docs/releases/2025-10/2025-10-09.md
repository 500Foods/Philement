Database queue creation, migration file handling

## Database Queue Creation

- Implemented comprehensive database queue creation system with support for multiple queue types (slow, medium, fast, cache) [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.c]
- Added database queue manager with capacity management and database-to-queue mapping [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.c]
- Enhanced queue creation with proper synchronization primitives and thread safety [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.c]
- Implemented Lead DQM (Database Queue Manager) with bootstrap-driven queue spawning for different priority levels [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical queue management with automatic scaling based on configuration parameters [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Implemented worker queue creation with database-specific tagging and priority-based processing [src/database/dbqueue/create_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for queue creation parameters [src/database/dbqueue/create_worker.c]

## Migration File Handling

- Enhanced migration file discovery system with support for both PAYLOAD and filesystem-based sources [src/database/migration/files.c]
- Implemented migration file sorting by version number with proper numeric parsing [src/database/migration/files.c]
- Added migration file validation with comprehensive error checking and logging [src/database/migration/validate.c]
- Enhanced migration file execution with transaction support across all database engines [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Implemented migration file cleanup and memory management for discovered file lists [src/database/migration/files.c]
- Added support for Lua-based migration files with proper module loading and execution [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Enhanced migration file processing with detailed execution logging and performance metrics [src/database/migration/execute.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for database queue creation and management functions [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/create_worker_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for migration file discovery, sorting, and validation [tests/unity/src/database/migration/files_test_*.c]
- Created coverage tests for Lead DQM bootstrap and queue spawning functionality [tests/unity/src/database/queue/lead_test_*.c]
- Added integration tests for migration file execution and transaction handling [tests/integration/database/migration_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for database queue manager capacity and mapping functionality [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/manager_test_*.c]
