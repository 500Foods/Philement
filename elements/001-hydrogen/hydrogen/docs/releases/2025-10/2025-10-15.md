Migration updates, Lua check test, diagram generation

## Migration Updates

- Enhanced database migration system with improved transaction handling and error recovery mechanisms [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Implemented advanced migration path detection with dependency analysis and conflict resolution [src/migration/path_handler.c]
- Added comprehensive migration validation with schema consistency checks and rollback capabilities [src/database/migration/validate.c]
- Enhanced migration file processing with support for Lua-based migration scripts and multi-engine compatibility [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Implemented Lead MHO (Migration Handler Operator) with configuration-driven migration strategies and resource allocation [src/migration/migration_handler_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical migration management with priority-based processing and performance monitoring [src/migration/create_migration_worker.c]

## Lua Check Test

- Implemented comprehensive Lua code analysis test using luacheck for static code quality validation [tests/test_38_luacheck.sh]
- Added Lua linting configuration with custom rules for database migration scripts and project-specific patterns [.lintignore-lua]
- Enhanced test framework integration with numbered output system for consistent reporting [tests/lib/framework.sh]
- Implemented parallel processing for multiple Lua file analysis with exclusion pattern support [tests/test_38_luacheck.sh]
- Added comprehensive error reporting and validation for Lua syntax, unused variables, and code style issues [tests/docs/test_38_luacheck.md]

## Diagram Generation

- Implemented automated SVG database diagram generation for all supported database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, DB2) [tests/test_39_database_diagrams.sh]
- Added parallel processing support for multiple engine/design combinations with metadata output [tests/lib/generate_diagram.sh]
- Enhanced diagram generation with preprocessing functions for data cleaning and optimal layout algorithms [tests/lib/generate_diagram.js]
- Implemented auto-fitting layout system for table positioning within diagram bounds and relationship visualization [images/acuranzo/]
- Added comprehensive metadata output including table counts, processing timestamps, and engine-specific optimizations [tests/lib/generate_diagram.sh]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for migration transaction handling and Lua integration [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for Lua check validation and diagram generation processes [tests/unity/src/lua_check_test_*.c]
- Created coverage tests for Lead MHO bootstrap and migration strategy execution [tests/unity/src/migration/lead_test_*.c]
- Added integration tests for migration updates, Lua analysis, and diagram generation pipeline [tests/integration/migration/lua_diagram_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for diagram generation metadata and layout optimization [tests/unity/src/diagram_test_*.c]

## Build and Metrics

- Updated build metrics and code statistics for October 15, 2025 [docs/metrics/2025-10/2025-10-15.json, docs/metrics/2025-10/2025-10-15.txt]
- Generated updated coverage and code metrics visualizations [images/COMPLETE.svg, images/CLOC_CODE.svg, images/CLOC_STAT.svg]
