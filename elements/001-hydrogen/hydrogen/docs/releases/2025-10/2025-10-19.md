Lead DQM algorithm, migration testing

## Lead DQM Algorithm Enhancements

- Enhanced Lead DQM algorithm with improved queue routing logic based on priority and load balancing [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:525-550]
- Implemented dynamic algorithm selection for migration actions with state-based decision making [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:72-99]
- Added algorithm optimization for child queue spawning with configuration-driven scaling [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:452-480]
- Enhanced migration cycle algorithm with transaction safety and error recovery mechanisms [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:242-288]
- Implemented algorithm for QTC population timing to ensure Conduit compatibility [src/database/dbqueue/lead.c:396-400]

## Migration Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive migration testing suite with algorithm validation and transaction testing [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_run_migration.c]
- Implemented migration test execution with configurable test parameters and result validation [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_run_migration_test.c]
- Enhanced migration testing with algorithm coverage for load and apply phases [tests/integration/database/migration_test_*.c]
- Added migration validation testing for empty databases and failed migration scenarios [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_manage_heartbeats.c]
- Implemented testing framework for migration action determination algorithms [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_establish_connection.c]

## Database Queue Infrastructure

- Updated database queue headers with algorithm function prototypes and migration testing interfaces [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.h:194-217]
- Enhanced queue management with algorithm-driven child queue lifecycle control [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.h:189-200]
- Added migration status tracking fields for algorithm state management [src/database/dbqueue/dbqueue.h:79-82]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for Lead DQM algorithm functions and migration testing [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_*.c]
- Implemented integration tests for algorithm execution and migration workflow validation [tests/integration/database/lead_dqm_test_*.c]
- Created coverage tests for algorithm optimization and migration testing scenarios [tests/unity/src/database/dbqueue/lead_test_spawn_child_queue.c]
