Migration path handling, backup cleanup

## Migration Path Handling

- Implemented comprehensive migration path detection and validation system with automatic conflict resolution [src/migration/path_handler.c]
- Added migration path planning with dependency analysis and execution ordering [src/migration/path_planner.c]
- Enhanced migration path handling with rollback capabilities and state tracking [src/migration/migration_manager.c]
- Implemented Lead MHO (Migration Handler Operator) with configuration-driven migration strategies [src/migration/migration_handler_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical migration management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/migration/migration_handler_lead.c]
- Implemented worker migration tasks with migration-specific tagging and performance monitoring [src/migration/create_migration_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for migration parameters and constraints [src/migration/create_migration_worker.c]

## Backup Cleanup

- Implemented automated backup cleanup system with retention policy enforcement and space optimization [src/backup/cleanup_manager.c]
- Added backup cleanup scheduling with configurable intervals and threshold-based triggers [src/backup/cleanup_scheduler.c]
- Enhanced backup cleanup with transaction-safe operations and integrity verification [src/backup/cleanup_processor.c]
- Implemented Lead BCO (Backup Cleanup Operator) with policy-driven cleanup strategies [src/backup/backup_cleanup_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical cleanup management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/backup/backup_cleanup_lead.c]
- Implemented worker cleanup tasks with backup-specific tagging and performance monitoring [src/backup/create_cleanup_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for cleanup parameters and constraints [src/backup/create_cleanup_worker.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for migration path handling functions and validation operations [tests/unity/src/migration/path_handler_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for backup cleanup system validation and retention policy execution [tests/unity/src/backup/cleanup_test_*.c]
- Created coverage tests for Lead MHO bootstrap and migration strategy execution [tests/unity/src/migration/lead_test_*.c]
- Added integration tests for migration path handling and backup cleanup pipeline [tests/integration/migration/cleanup_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for Lead BCO bootstrap and cleanup strategy execution [tests/unity/src/backup/lead_test_*.c]
