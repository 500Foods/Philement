Database migrations, Lead DQM implementation

## Database Subsystem

- Implemented Lead DQM (Database Queue Manager) architecture with dynamic child queue spawning [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Added comprehensive Lead DQM initialization with bootstrap-driven queue launching [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Enhanced database migration system with unified transaction handling across all engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DB2) [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Implemented prepared statement caching and hash-based statement identification for migration execution [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Added detailed trace logging for migration statements with execution timing and affected row counts [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Improved error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed migrations across all database engines [src/database/migration/transaction.c]

## Lead DQM Architecture

- Lead DQM acts as conductor for database operations, orchestrating entire database lifecycle [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Implemented hierarchical queue management with Lead queue spawning child worker queues for different priority levels [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Added bootstrap-driven queue launching based on configuration (start/min/max per queue type) [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Implemented intelligent scaling with automatic spawning of worker queues after successful bootstrap [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Added comprehensive thread safety with proper synchronization throughout Lead DQM operations [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]
- Enhanced logging with structured DQM labeling system (DQM-<DatabaseName>-<QueueNumber>-<TagLetters>) [src/database/queue/database_queue_lead.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for Lead DQM initialization and child queue spawning [tests/unity/src/database/queue/database_queue_lead_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for database migration transaction execution across all supported engines [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_execute_transaction.c]
- Created coverage tests for migration parsing, statement validation, and error path handling [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_execute_transaction.c]
- Added integration tests for Lead DQM bootstrap-driven queue launching [tests/integration/database/lead_dqm_bootstrap_test.c]
