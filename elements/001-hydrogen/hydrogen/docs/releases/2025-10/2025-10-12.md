Database query improvements, prepared statements

## Database Query Improvements

- Implemented optimized query execution engine with intelligent caching and performance monitoring [src/database/query_optimizer.c]
- Added query result caching with TTL-based invalidation and memory-efficient storage [src/database/query_cache.c]
- Enhanced query parsing with advanced syntax validation and comprehensive error reporting [src/database/query_parser.c]
- Implemented Lead DQO (Database Query Operator) with configuration-driven query optimization strategies [src/database/query_handler_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical query management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/database/query_handler_lead.c]
- Implemented worker query tasks with query-specific tagging and execution monitoring [src/database/create_query_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for query parameters and constraints [src/database/create_query_worker.c]

## Prepared Statements

- Implemented prepared statement support with secure parameter binding and execution planning [src/database/prepared_stmt.c]
- Added statement caching and reuse mechanisms for improved performance and reduced overhead [src/database/stmt_cache.c]
- Enhanced prepared statement validation with type checking and constraint enforcement [src/database/stmt_validator.c]
- Implemented Lead PSO (Prepared Statement Operator) with statement lifecycle management [src/database/stmt_handler_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical statement management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/database/stmt_handler_lead.c]
- Implemented worker statement tasks with statement-specific tagging and performance monitoring [src/database/create_stmt_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for statement parameters and constraints [src/database/create_stmt_worker.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for query optimization functions and caching operations [tests/unity/src/database/query_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for prepared statement execution and validation mechanisms [tests/unity/src/database/stmt_test_*.c]
- Created coverage tests for Lead DQO bootstrap and query strategy execution [tests/unity/src/database/lead_query_test_*.c]
- Added integration tests for database query improvements and prepared statement pipeline [tests/integration/database/query_stmt_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for Lead PSO bootstrap and statement strategy execution [tests/unity/src/database/lead_stmt_test_*.c]
