Database reorganization, CMake updates

## Database Reorganization

- Implemented comprehensive database table reorganization with automatic index optimization and fragmentation reduction [src/database/reorg/table_reorg.c]
- Added database schema reorganization system with support for table partitioning and data redistribution [src/database/reorg/schema_reorg.c]
- Enhanced database reorganization with transaction-safe operations and rollback capabilities [src/database/reorg/reorg_manager.c]
- Implemented Lead DRO (Database Reorganization Operator) with configuration-driven reorganization strategies [src/database/reorg/database_reorg_lead.c]
- Added hierarchical reorganization management with priority-based processing and resource allocation [src/database/reorg/database_reorg_lead.c]
- Implemented worker reorganization tasks with database-specific tagging and performance monitoring [src/database/reorg/create_reorg_worker.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation for reorganization parameters and constraints [src/database/reorg/create_reorg_worker.c]

## CMake Updates

- Updated CMake build system with enhanced cross-platform support and dependency management [CMakeLists.txt]
- Implemented CMake module updates for improved library detection and linking [cmake/Modules/FindDependencies.cmake]
- Enhanced CMake configuration with support for multiple build types and optimization flags [CMakeLists.txt]
- Added CMake presets for development, testing, and production builds [CMakePresets.json]
- Implemented CMake toolchain updates for better compiler detection and feature flags [cmake/Toolchains.cmake]
- Enhanced CMake packaging system with improved installer generation and distribution support [cmake/Packaging.cmake]
- Added comprehensive CMake documentation and build instructions [docs/cmake/README.md]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for database reorganization functions and schema operations [tests/unity/src/database/reorg/table_reorg_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for CMake build system validation and configuration parsing [tests/cmake/build_test_*.cmake]
- Created coverage tests for Lead DRO bootstrap and reorganization strategy execution [tests/unity/src/database/reorg/lead_test_*.c]
- Added integration tests for database reorganization and CMake build pipeline [tests/integration/database/reorg_test_*.c]
- Implemented tests for CMake module loading and dependency resolution [tests/cmake/modules_test_*.cmake]

## Build and Metrics

- Updated build metrics and code statistics for October 10, 2025 [docs/metrics/2025-10/2025-10-10.json, docs/metrics/2025-10/2025-10-10.txt]
- Generated updated coverage and code metrics visualizations [images/COMPLETE.svg, images/CLOC_CODE.svg, images/CLOC_STAT.svg]
