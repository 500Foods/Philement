Database migration execution, Lua integration

## Database Migration Execution

- Implemented unified transaction handling for database migrations across all supported engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DB2) [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Added prepared statement caching with hash-based statement identification for migration execution [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Enhanced migration transaction system with explicit begin/commit/rollback operations for each database engine [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Implemented detailed trace logging for migration statements with execution timing and affected row counts [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Added comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed migrations across all database engines [src/database/migration/transaction.c]

## Lua Integration

- Implemented Lua script loading and execution system for database migrations [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Added Lua state setup with standard libraries and debug support for migration processing [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Created database engine module loading system for Lua-based schema definitions [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Implemented Lua database module loading with support for multiple database engines (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, DB2) [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Added migration file execution with Lua function calling and query table extraction [src/database/migration/lua.c]
- Enhanced Lua integration with run_migration function execution and SQL result processing [src/database/migration/lua.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for database migration transaction execution across all supported engines [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_execute_transaction.c]
- Implemented tests for Lua database module loading and migration execution [tests/unity/src/database/migration/lua_test_load_database_module.c]
- Created coverage tests for migration parsing, statement validation, and error path handling [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_execute_transaction.c]
- Added integration tests for Lua-based migration file processing and SQL generation [tests/unity/src/database/migration/lua_test_load_database_module.c]
