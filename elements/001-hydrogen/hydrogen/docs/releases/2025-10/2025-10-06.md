Database launch logging, migration transaction handling

## Database Subsystem

- Enhanced database launch logging with detailed connection information and subsystem state tracking [src/launch/launch_database.c]
- Improved database configuration validation with comprehensive library dependency checks and version matching [src/launch/launch_database.c]
- Added detailed logging for database engine counts by type (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DB2) with connection names [src/launch/launch_database.c]
- Streamlined launch readiness checks with cleaner output formatting and dependency verification [src/launch/launch_database.c]

## Database Migration System

- Implemented unified transaction handling for all database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DB2) with explicit transaction control [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Added comprehensive transaction parsing for multi-statement SQL with "-- QUERY DELIMITER" support [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Enhanced migration execution with prepared statement caching and hash-based statement identification [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Improved error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed migrations across all database engines [src/database/migration/transaction.c]
- Added detailed trace logging for migration statements with execution timing and affected row counts [src/database/migration/transaction.c]

## Testing Framework

- Added comprehensive unit tests for database migration transaction execution across all supported engines [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_execute_transaction.c]
- Implemented tests for transaction parsing, statement validation, and error path handling [tests/unity/src/database/migration/transaction_test_execute_transaction.c]
- Created coverage tests for database launch readiness checks and logging functionality [tests/unity/src/launch/launch_database_test_*.c]
