# Release Notes for 2025-Jun-30 (Mon)

## Unity Testing Framework

- Added detailed documentation for the Unity test framework in `tests/unity/README.md`, covering an overview of Unity and installation instructions for the framework files.
- Updated `test_30_unity_tests.sh` to automate the download of the Unity framework if missing, ensuring it is placed in the correct directory structure (`tests/unity/framework/Unity/`) as expected by CMake configuration [tests/test_30_unity_tests.sh].
- Fixed shellcheck issues in `test_30_unity_tests.sh` for direct exit code checking of download commands [tests/test_30_unity_tests.sh].
- Ensured consistency between manual installation instructions in `tests/unity/README.md` and the automated process in the test script [tests/unity/README.md].

## Testing Documentation

- Updated `tests/README.md` to include a description of `test_30_unity_tests.sh`, detailing its role in running unit tests with the Unity framework, and added a link to the Unity-specific documentation [tests/README.md].

## Socket Rebinding and Network Infrastructure

- Fixed critical socket rebinding issue in WebSocket server by adding `LWS_SERVER_OPTION_ALLOW_LISTEN_SHARE` flag to enable SO_REUSEADDR functionality [src/websocket/websocket_server.c]
- Enhanced Web server port availability checking to use SO_REUSEADDR consistently with actual server configuration, eliminating false negatives during rapid restart scenarios [src/webserver/web_server_core.c]
- Resolved inconsistency between port availability testing and actual server binding that caused intermittent failures in test environments [src/webserver/web_server_core.c]

## Testing Framework Enhancements

- Enhanced Test 55 (Socket Rebinding Test) to v3.0.0 with actual HTTP request generation, creating realistic TIME_WAIT socket conditions for proper SO_REUSEADDR validation [tests/test_55_socket_rebind.sh]
- Updated Test 60 (API Prefix Test) to v4.0.0 with immediate restart approach, removing unnecessary TIME_WAIT delays and fixing shellcheck warnings [tests/test_60_api_prefixes.sh]
- Updated Test 70 (Swagger Test) to v3.0.0 with immediate restart approach, eliminating TIME_WAIT waiting logic while maintaining comprehensive UI testing [tests/test_70_swagger.sh]
- Fixed critical understanding of test behavior differences: tests with HTTP requests create TIME_WAIT sockets requiring SO_REUSEADDR, while tests without requests avoid this condition entirely

## Support_Sitemap Updated

- Added support for excluding files/folders using the normal .lintignore mechanism which in this case is used to exclude the Unity documentation
