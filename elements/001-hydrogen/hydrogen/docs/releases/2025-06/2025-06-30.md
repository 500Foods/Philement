# Release Notes for 2025-Jun-30 (Mon)

## Unity Testing Framework

- Added detailed documentation for the Unity test framework in `tests/unity/README.md`, covering an overview of Unity and installation instructions for the framework files.
- Updated `test_30_unity_tests.sh` to automate the download of the Unity framework if missing, ensuring it is placed in the correct directory structure (`tests/unity/framework/Unity/`) as expected by CMake configuration [tests/test_30_unity_tests.sh].
- Fixed shellcheck issues in `test_30_unity_tests.sh` for direct exit code checking of download commands [tests/test_30_unity_tests.sh].
- Ensured consistency between manual installation instructions in `tests/unity/README.md` and the automated process in the test script [tests/unity/README.md].

## Testing Documentation

- Updated `tests/README.md` to include a description of `test_30_unity_tests.sh`, detailing its role in running unit tests with the Unity framework, and added a link to the Unity-specific documentation [tests/README.md].

## Support_Sitemap Updated

- Added support for excluding files/folders using the normal .lintignore mechanism which in this case is used to exclude the Unity documentation
