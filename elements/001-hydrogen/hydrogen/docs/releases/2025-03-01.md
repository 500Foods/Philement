## API Architecture

- Refactored OIDC endpoints into separate directories:
  - Separated combined OIDC endpoint implementation into individual endpoint handlers
  - Created dedicated directories for each OIDC endpoint (discovery, authorization, token, etc.)
  - Created consistent interface with clear separation of concerns
  - Followed same organizational pattern as system endpoints
  - Maintained utility functions in central oidc_service for shared functionality

## Web Server

- Added Brotli compression:
  - Created compression utility module with client detection
  - Implemented pre-compressed .br file serving for static content
  - Added on-the-fly compression for API JSON responses
  - Added dynamic compression level selection based on content size:
    - Level 11 (highest) for content ≤5KB
    - Level 6 (medium) for content >5KB and ≤500KB
    - Level 4 (lower) for content >500KB
  - Integrated proper Content-Encoding headers
  - Added libbrotli dependency for encoding/decoding
  - Added detailed compression logging with timing information and compression level

- Fixed socket binding on server restart:
  - Implemented SO_REUSEADDR socket option to allow immediate port rebinding
  - Eliminated TIME_WAIT state blocking when restarting server (~60s delay)
  - Used MHD_OPTION_LISTENING_ADDRESS_REUSE for cleaner implementation
  - Created dedicated test for verifying socket rebinding functionality
  - Improved error handling with proper timeout-based testing

## Testing

- Enhanced test system with socket rebinding verification:
  - Integrated socket rebinding test into main test suite
  - Added proper signal handling for test script interruption
  - Implemented robust cleanup functions to prevent process leaks
  - Added timeout handling for reliable test execution
  - Created version-aware test integration for different microhttpd versions
  - Added special handling for SIGTERM to avoid false test failures
  - Improved test sequencing with socket rebinding check before endpoint tests
  - Enhanced resource cleanup between sequential tests

## Build System

- Added all-variants build target:
  - Created single command to build all configurations
  - Added clean step before building for fresh environment
  - Added output message listing all successfully built variants
  - Streamlined full rebuild process for testing

- Added performance build variant:
  - Implemented -O3 optimization level for maximum speed
  - Added -march=native for CPU-specific optimizations
  - Added -ffast-math for optimized floating-point operations
  - Implemented -finline-functions for aggressive inlining
  - Added -funroll-loops for automatic loop optimization
  - Created dedicated build directory for performance artifacts
  - Updated test framework to verify performance build

## Documentation

- Enhanced project documentation for improved efficiency:
  - Created README.md for src/api/ directory with implementation details
  - Updated AI_ASSISTANT.md with expanded project information
  - Added troubleshooting guide to AI_ASSISTANT.md
  - Added contribution guidelines and performance optimization sections
  - Added detailed security considerations beyond coding guidelines
  - Improved timezone references and release notes formatting guidance
  - Added future roadmap and external dependencies information
  - Added CI/CD integration details
