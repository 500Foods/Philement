## Code Cleanup

- Cleaned up utils_dependency.c:
  - Removed duplicate function implementations
  - Fixed forward declarations
  - Removed unused function declarations
  - Standardized logging functions

## Configuration Structure

- Added ServerConfig struct to group server-related configuration values:
  - Moved server_name, payload_key, and log_file_path into ServerConfig
  - Added startup_delay field for configurable thread initialization timing
  - Updated config.h with new structure definition
- Modified config.c to load values from the "Server" JSON object:
  - Updated configuration loading to use the new structure
  - Added fallback defaults when Server object is missing
  - Added logging for each server configuration parameter
- Updated default configuration handling to support the new structure
- Reorganized configuration logging to group values by section:
  - Added log_config_section_header to display section names
  - Added log_config_section_item for indented configuration values
  - Updated all sections to use section-based logging format
  - Each configuration item now listed under its parent section
- Enhanced configuration value logging:
  - Added special handling for environment variables using "Config-Env" subsystem
  - Formatted environment variables as "$ENV_VAR: value" in log entries
  - Improved environment variable handling for keys containing "key" (case-insensitive)
  - Implemented truncation of sensitive values (keys, tokens, passwords) to 5 characters
  - Fixed PayloadKey environment variable handling with proper truncation
- Improved configuration validation:
  - Fixed integer parsing to correctly handle values like StartupDelay
  - Removed unnecessary range checking that caused incorrect numeric values
  - Fixed size_t validation to ensure proper MaxUploadSize values 
  - Added explicit fallback to defaults for out-of-range values
  - Removed excessive debug messages and default logging from configuration processing

## Startup Sequence

- Updated startup.c to use the new ServerConfig structure:
  - Modified references to app_config->server_name and log_file_path
  - Implemented configurable thread initialization delay
  - Added thread launch wait time based on StartupDelay parameter
  - Added logging for StartupDelay value in milliseconds
- Updated additional components to use the nested ServerConfig structure:
  - Fixed startup_mdns_server.c to reference server_name from server structure
  - Fixed startup_logging.c to reference log_file_path from server structure
  - Fixed web_server_payload.c to reference payload_key from server structure
  - Fixed utils_status.c to reference log_file_path from server structure
  - Resolved compilation errors in subsystem initializations, payload handling, and status reporting
- Improved configuration information logging with new structure data
