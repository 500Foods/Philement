## Shutdown Timing Enhancement

**Timing System:**

- Enhanced shutdown timing with precise elapsed time tracking starting when shutdown signal is received [src/state/state.c](../../../src/state/state.c)
- Added total running time calculation from startup completion to shutdown initiation [src/utils/utils_time.c]../(../../src/utils/utils_time.c)
- Added total elapsed time calculation from application start to shutdown completion [src/utils/utils_time.c](../../../src/utils/utils_time.c)

**Shutdown Process:**

- Enhanced final shutdown message to display three timing metrics: shutdown elapsed time, total running time, and total elapsed time [src/landing/landing.c](../../../src/landing/landing.c)
- Integrated startup completion timing tracking for accurate running time calculations [src/launch/launch.c](../../../src/launch/launch.c)

**API Extensions:**

- Added `record_startup_complete_time()` and `record_shutdown_initiate_time()` functions [src/utils/utils_time.h](../../../src/utils/utils_time.h)
- Added `calculate_total_running_time()` and `calculate_total_elapsed_time()` functions [src/utils/utils_time.h](../../../src/utils/utils_time.h)
