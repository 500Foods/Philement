# 2025-07-01 (Tue): CMake Build System, OIDC Examples

## CMake Build System

- Fixed `_GNU_SOURCE` redefinition errors in example compilation [examples/C/auth_code_flow.c, examples/C/client_credentials.c, examples/C/password_flow.c]
- Added OpenSSL library linking for OIDC client examples [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]
- Resolved color code parsing issues in CMake echo commands [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]
- Enhanced example build targets with proper dependency management [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]

## OIDC Examples

- Removed duplicate `_GNU_SOURCE` macro definitions from Authorization Code flow example [examples/C/auth_code_flow.c]
- Removed duplicate `_GNU_SOURCE` macro definitions from Client Credentials flow example [examples/C/client_credentials.c]
- Removed duplicate `_GNU_SOURCE` macro definitions from Resource Owner Password flow example [examples/C/password_flow.c]

## Testing

- Fixed compilation test failures for OIDC client examples [tests/test_10_compilation.sh]
- Achieved 7 of 7 subtests passing in compilation test suite [tests/test_10_compilation.sh]
- Resolved linker errors for OpenSSL functions in example programs [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]

## Build System

- Updated example library dependencies to include OpenSSL::SSL and OpenSSL::Crypto [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]
- Fixed all_examples target to build successfully without errors [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]
- Maintained compatibility with existing CMake build workflow [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]
