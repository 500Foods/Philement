# Release Note - 2025-07-07

## Hydrogen Project Updates

- **Shellcheck Justification Subtest Compliance**: Updated all shell scripts to include justifications for shellcheck directives, ensuring compliance with Test 99's shellcheck justification subtest. This update enhances code quality by documenting the rationale behind each shellcheck exception, making maintenance and reviews more transparent.

- **Fixed Markdown Links Check Test (Test 90)**: Resolved extraction logic issues in `test_90_check_links.sh` for parsing missing links and orphaned files counts from formatted table output. The fix includes proper handling of ANSI color codes and Unicode characters that were preventing accurate count extraction. The script now correctly identifies and reports both missing links and orphaned markdown files, with validation that extracted counts match the sitemap exit code.

- **Test Suite Reliability Improvements**: Fixed critical test failures in Test 16 (Library Dependencies) and Test 34 (Swagger) by standardizing their approach to match the working Test 20 pattern. Test 16 was updated to use the `run_lifecycle_test` function instead of manual startup/shutdown management, improving reliability from 0/14 to 14/14 passing tests. Test 34 had variable name and PID scoping issues resolved.

- **Shellcheck Warning Resolution**: Addressed SC2153 warnings across 9 test files by adding appropriate `# shellcheck disable=SC2153` comments with documentation. These warnings were false positives for the `HYDROGEN_BIN` variable which is dynamically set by the `find_hydrogen_binary` function. The disable comments properly document this intentional pattern.

- **Enhanced Markdown Links Check Test (Test 90)**: Implemented sophisticated table detection algorithm to distinguish between column headers and dedicated issue tables. Fixed extraction logic for missing links and orphaned files counts with proper ANSI color code handling and Unicode character processing. Added validation that extracted counts match the sitemap exit code for improved reliability. [tests/test_90_check_links.sh]

- **Shellcheck Justification Enforcement**: Added new subtest to Test 99 (Static Codebase Analysis) that validates all shellcheck directives include proper justifications. This ensures code quality by requiring documentation for each shellcheck exception, making maintenance and reviews more transparent. The test analyzes all shell scripts and reports any directives lacking explanatory comments. [tests/test_99_codebase.sh]
