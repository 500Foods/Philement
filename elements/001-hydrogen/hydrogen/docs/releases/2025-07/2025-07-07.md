# Release Note - 2025-07-07

## Hydrogen Project Updates

- **Shellcheck Justification Subtest Compliance**: Updated all shell scripts to include justifications for shellcheck directives, ensuring compliance with Test 99's shellcheck justification subtest. This update enhances code quality by documenting the rationale behind each shellcheck exception, making maintenance and reviews more transparent.

- **Fixed Markdown Links Check Test (Test 90)**: Resolved extraction logic issues in `test_90_check_links.sh` for parsing missing links and orphaned files counts from formatted table output. The fix includes proper handling of ANSI color codes and Unicode characters that were preventing accurate count extraction. The script now correctly identifies and reports both missing links and orphaned markdown files, with validation that extracted counts match the sitemap exit code.
