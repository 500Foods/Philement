# Release Notes for 2025-Jul-18 (Fri)

## WebSocket Server

- Optimized shutdown process with custom connection tracking and force-close mechanism [src/websocket/websocket_server_shutdown.c](../../../src/websocket/websocket_server_shutdown.c), [src/websocket/websocket_server_context.c](../../../src/websocket/websocket_server_context.c)
- Fixed compilation error in force-close function by using `lws_close_reason` and `lws_callback_on_writable`
- Added detailed timing logging to measure shutdown duration in milliseconds
- Multiple optimization attempts to reduce `lws_context_destroy` delay, though full resolution not achieved due to internal libwebsockets constraints

## Testing Framework

- Updated SVG visualization for test results (carried over from earlier entry)
- Implemented a caching mechanism for ShellCheck results in `test_92_shellcheck.sh`. Results are now stored in `~/.shellcheck` and reused for unchanged files, significantly reducing runtime on subsequent test executions.
- Applied a similar caching mechanism to `test_98_markdownlint.sh` for markdownlint results, storing them in `~/.markdownlint` to optimize performance by reusing results for unchanged markdown files.
