# 2025-07-17 (Thu) - WebSocket Naming Consistency

## WebSocket System

- Standardized subsystem name from "WebSockets" to "WebSocket" throughout launch/landing system [src/launch/launch_websocket.c, src/landing/landing_websocket.c]
- Updated subsystem references in launch readiness checks [src/launch/launch_readiness.c, src/landing/landing_readiness.c]
- Fixed naming inconsistencies in launch and landing orchestration [src/launch/launch.c, src/landing/landing.c]

## Testing Framework

- Fixed awk compatibility issue in coverage scripts that caused Test 99 to fail on Ubuntu systems [tests/lib/coverage-common.sh, tests/lib/coverage-unity.sh, tests/lib/coverage-blackbox.sh]
- Replaced GNU awk specific `[[:space:]]` character class with universally compatible `[ \t]` patterns
- Resolved "syntax error at or near [" errors in GitHub Codespaces and other Ubuntu environments
- Fixed readonly variable redeclaration error in test scripts when sourced by orchestration script [tests/test_*.sh]
- Added conditional declaration guards to prevent LINT_EXCLUDES and LINT_OUTPUT_LIMIT readonly variable conflicts during parallel test execution
- Resolved "LINT_EXCLUDES: readonly variable" and "LINT_OUTPUT_LIMIT: readonly variable" errors that occurred when running tests via test_00_all.sh orchestration
- Enhanced Unity test coverage consistency by including hydrogen.c in coverage instrumentation without linking conflicts [cmake/CMakeLists.txt]
- Fixed coverage reporting discrepancy between Unity tests and blackbox tests (now both report same instrumented line counts)
