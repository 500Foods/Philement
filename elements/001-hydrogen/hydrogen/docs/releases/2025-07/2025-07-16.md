# Release Notes: 2025-07-16 (Wed)

## Testing Framework

**Unity Test Batching Algorithm**:

- Changed test batching formula to divide tests evenly into minimum groups within CPU limit
- Previously: batches sized to number of CPUs (e.g., 12 tests + 2 tests on 12-CPU system)
- Now: evenly distributed groups (e.g., 7 tests + 7 tests on 12-CPU system)
- Updated version to 2.3.0 with changelog entry
- [tests/test_11_unity.sh](../../../tests/test_10_unity.sh)

## Changes Summary

**Files Modified**: 1 file, ~10 lines changed

**Key Changes**:

- Modified batch size calculation in `run_unity_tests()` function
- Added ceiling division to calculate optimal group distribution
- Updated script version and changelog per coding standards

**Technical Details**:

- Old formula: `batch_size = cpu_cores`
- New formula: `number_of_groups = ceil(total_tests / cpu_cores)`, `batch_size = ceil(total_tests / number_of_groups)`
- Improves test distribution efficiency and reduces overall execution time
- Better utilizes available CPU cores for parallel test execution
