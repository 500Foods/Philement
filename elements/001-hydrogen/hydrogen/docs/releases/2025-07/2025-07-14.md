# 2025-07-14 (Mon): Test Framework Architecture Overhaul

Major Test Framework Improvements:

## Test 32 System Endpoints - Complete Architectural Restructure

**Problem Identified:**

- Test 32 had persistent failures in parallel execution (3/17 subtests passing)
- Monolithic architecture with 18 sequential subtests depending on single server instance
- Complex error handling with race conditions in validate_api_request function
- Aggressive timing (0.2s intervals) causing resource contention

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Test 30 (working): 10 subtests, 2 server instances, modular restart approach
- Test 32 (failing): 18 subtests, 1 server instance, monolithic approach  
- Test 34 (working): 15 subtests, 2 server instances, modular function approach

**Major Architectural Changes [tests/test_32_system_endpoints.sh v3.1.0]:**

1. **Modular Design**: Created `test_system_endpoints()` function following test 34's successful pattern
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Streamlined from 18 subtests to 6 focused core subtests
3. **Better Isolation**: Each test function manages its own server lifecycle with proper cleanup
4. **Simplified Error Handling**: Removed complex validation logic that caused race conditions
5. **Conservative Timing**: Updated to use 0.5s intervals matching test 30's proven approach
6. **Focused Testing**: Concentrates on core endpoints (health, info, config, test) rather than exhaustive coverage

**Technical Improvements:**

- Server Management: Uses temporary PID variables to avoid conflicts
- Error Handling: Simplified curl execution without complex file operations  
- Resource Cleanup: Proper server shutdown and TIME_WAIT socket checking
- Timing: Conservative approach that matches working tests

**Expected Outcome:**

- Significantly improved reliability in parallel test execution
- Better alignment with proven architectural patterns from tests 30 and 34
- Reduced race conditions and resource contention issues

## Unity Testing Framework Expansion

**Launch Plan Unit Tests [tests/unity/src/launch/test_launch_plan.c]:**

- Added comprehensive Unity unit tests for launch_plan.c functionality
- Covers handle_launch_plan function with 14 test cases including edge cases and boundary conditions
- Tests null parameter handling, empty results, mixed readiness states, and maximum subsystem scenarios
- Validates launch plan logic with real logging integration
- Integrated with CMake build system for automated execution

## Additional Test Framework Enhancements

**Test Suite Runner [tests/test_00_all.sh v4.1.0]:**

- Added `--sequential-groups` option for mixed execution modes
- Allows specific test groups to run sequentially while others run in parallel
- Syntax: `--sequential-groups=3,4` runs groups 3x and 4x sequentially
- Addresses process identifier communication issues in specific test groups (e.g., group 30)
- Maintains performance benefits of parallel execution for unaffected groups
- Enhanced help documentation with clear usage examples

**Unity Testing Framework [tests/test_11_unity.sh v2.0.3]:**

- Enhanced individual test reporting with INFO lines showing test descriptions and purposes
- Displays each Unity test result with test name and status (PASS/FAIL/IGNORE)
- Provides detailed visibility into individual test execution within Unity test suites
- Improved test output clarity for debugging and monitoring

**Test Framework Resilience [tests/test_32_system_endpoints.sh v3.1.3, tests/test_34_swagger.sh v3.1.3]:**

- Added retry logic to HTTP request functions for subsystem initialization delays
- Enhanced error handling for 404 responses and HTML error pages during startup
- Improved parallel execution stability with 3-attempt retry patterns
- Added proper success messaging for requests that succeed on retry attempts

**Lifecycle Management [tests/lib/lifecycle.sh v1.2.2]:**

- Fixed job control messages appearing in test output by adding disown to background processes
- Improved process cleanup and signal handling

**Test Framework Reliability:**

- Enhanced parallel execution stability across the test suite
- Better error isolation and reporting mechanisms
- Improved resource management during concurrent test runs
