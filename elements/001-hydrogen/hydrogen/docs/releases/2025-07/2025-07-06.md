# Release Notes - 2025-Jul-06 (Sun)

## Overview

This release includes updates to the testing framework, specifically addressing hardcoded absolute paths in test scripts to improve portability.

## Changes

**Testing:**

- Removed hardcoded absolute path in test 92 (`test_92_unity.sh`) as it is now handled dynamically by `log_output.sh` [tests/test_92_unity.sh]
- Reviewed code and confirmed no additional absolute path references were found
