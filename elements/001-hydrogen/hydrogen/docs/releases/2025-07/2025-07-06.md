# Release Notes - 2025-Jul-06 (Sun)

## Overview

This release includes updates to the testing framework, specifically addressing hardcoded absolute paths in test scripts to improve portability.

## Changes

**Testing:**

- Removed hardcoded absolute path in test 92 (`test_92_unity.sh`) as it is now handled dynamically by `log_output.sh` [tests/test_92_unity.sh]
- Reviewed code and confirmed no additional absolute path references were found
- Updated test 16 (`test_16_library_dependencies.sh`) to accept "Less" as a passing status in addition to "Good" and "Less Good" for dependency checks [tests/test_16_library_dependencies.sh]
