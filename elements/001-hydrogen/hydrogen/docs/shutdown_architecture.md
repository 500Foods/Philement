# Shutdown Architecture

This document describes the shutdown architecture of the Hydrogen server, focusing on the mechanisms that ensure safe, reliable, and complete termination of all system components.

## Core Principles

The Hydrogen server's shutdown mechanism is designed with several critical principles in mind:

1. **Hardware Safety**: 3D printers contain heating elements, motors, and other physically active components that must be powered down safely to prevent damage or hazards.

2. **Print Job Preservation**: When possible, print job state should be saved to enable recovery.

3. **Resource Cleanup**: All system resources (memory, file handles, network connections) must be properly released to prevent leaks.

4. **Thread Coordination**: All threads must terminate cleanly without deadlocks or race conditions.

5. **Graceful Service Termination**: Network services must complete pending operations and notify clients before terminating.

6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If preferred shutdown methods fail, progressive fallbacks ensure eventual system termination.

## Shutdown Sequence

The shutdown process follows a carefully orchestrated sequence:

1. **Initiation**:
   - Triggered by SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or programmatic call to `graceful_shutdown()`
   - Sets `server_running = 0` and signals all threads via condition variable

2. **Service Announcement Termination**:
   - mDNS Server shutdown initiated first
   - "Goodbye" packets sent with TTL=0 to notify network of service withdrawal
   - Sockets closed and resources freed

3. **Network Services Termination**:
   - Web server shutdown
   - WebSocket server shutdown with client notification
   - Waiting for active connections to complete

4. **Print System Termination**:
   - Queue processing halted
   - Current job status preserved if possible
   - Resources released

5. **Network Resource Cleanup**:
   - Network interfaces freed
   - Shared network information released

6. **Thread Monitoring and Cleanup**:
   - Wait for threads to exit with progressive timeouts
   - Thread status verification
   - Thread cleanup with fallback mechanisms

7. **Final Resource Cleanup**:
   - Queue system destruction
   - Synchronization primitives destruction
   - Configuration cleanup

## Thread Management

Hydrogen employs a sophisticated thread tracking system:

1. **Thread Registration**:
   - Threads register using `add_service_thread()` when started
   - Thread IDs and metrics stored in service-specific thread pools

2. **Thread Metrics**:
   - Regular calls to `update_service_thread_metrics()` maintain current thread status
   - Dead threads automatically pruned from metrics

3. **Thread Termination**:
   - Primary mechanism: Signal threads to self-terminate via condition variables
   - Secondary mechanism: Join threads with timeout
   - Fallback mechanism: Thread cancellation for stuck threads

4. **Thread Verification**:
   - Shutdown process verifies actual thread termination
   - Checks thread state via `/proc/{tid}/status` when available
   - Identifies threads in uninterruptible sleep states (D state)

## Resource Cleanup

Resources are released in a specific order to prevent use-after-free scenarios:

1. **Two-Phase Pointer Handling**:
   - Store local copy of resource pointer
   - Set global pointer to NULL
   - Free resource using local copy

2. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - Free dynamically allocated structures in reverse allocation order
   - Recursively free complex data structures
   - NULL pointers after freeing to prevent double-free

3. **Handle Closing**:
   - Close file descriptors and sockets explicitly
   - Verify closure success

4. **State Reset**:
   - Reset volatile flags
   - Clear shared state structures

## WebSocket Server Shutdown

The WebSocket server uses libwebsockets, which requires special handling:

1. **Initial Signal Phase**:
   - Set `websocket_server_shutdown = 1`
   - Broadcast on condition variable

2. **Connection Closure Phase**:
   - Wait for connections to close gracefully (2s timeout)
   - Call `stop_websocket_server()` to initiate server thread termination

3. **Thread Termination Phase**:
   - Join server thread with 5s timeout
   - Use `pthread_timedjoin_np()` for controlled waiting

4. **Resource Cleanup Phase**:
   - Wait for thread exit before context destruction
   - Local copy of context pointer to prevent race conditions
   - Clean service loops to process all pending events
   - Context destruction with proper synchronization

5. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Force connection count to zero after timeout
   - Cancel service explicitly if normal termination fails
   - Delay final resource destruction to ensure callbacks complete

## mDNS Server Shutdown

The mDNS Server requires special network-aware shutdown:

1. **Service Withdrawal**:
   - Send RFC-compliant "goodbye" packets (TTL=0) for all services
   - Send on all network interfaces (IPv4 and IPv6)
   - Repeat 3 times with 250ms delay for reliability

2. **Thread Coordination**:
   - Set `mdns_server_system_shutdown = 1`
   - Wait for mDNS threads to notice shutdown flag
   - Progressive timeouts (10 x 200ms) for thread exit

3. **Socket Cleanup**:
   - Explicit socket closing for each interface
   - Both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets properly closed

4. **Resource Cleanup**:
   - Free interface structures in correct order
   - Release all dynamically allocated memory
   - Brief delay before final cleanup

## Synchronization Primitives

Shutdown relies on several synchronization mechanisms:

1. **Mutex Protection**:
   - `terminate_mutex` protects shared state
   - Component-specific mutexes protect subsystem state

2. **Condition Variables**:
   - `terminate_cond` for signaling shutdown
   - Component-specific condition variables for subsystem coordination

3. **Atomic Operations**:
   - Volatile sig_atomic_t flags for signal-safe state changes
   - Thread-safe counter operations

## Error Handling During Shutdown

The shutdown process is designed to be resilient to errors:

1. **Progressive Timeouts**:
   - Initial generous timeouts for normal operation
   - Shorter secondary timeouts for forced cleanup

2. **Isolation of Components**:
   - Each component shutdown isolated to prevent cascading failures
   - Failures in one component don't prevent others from shutting down

3. **Extensive Logging**:
   - Detailed logging of each shutdown step
   - Error conditions recorded for post-mortem analysis

4. **Shutdown State Tracking**:
   - `server_stopping` flag differentiates normal and shutdown states
   - Prevents inappropriate resource acquisition during shutdown

## Shutdown Monitoring

The shutdown process itself is monitored:

1. **Timing Statistics**:
   - `record_shutdown_start_time()` and `record_shutdown_end_time()`
   - Total shutdown duration available for performance analysis

2. **Thread State Analysis**:
   - Advanced state analysis via /proc filesystem
   - Detection of stuck threads in uninterruptible states
   - Syscall identification for blocked threads

3. **Resource Usage Tracking**:
   - Memory leaks detection
   - File descriptor tracking
   - Network socket monitoring

## Best Practices for Component Developers

When adding new components to Hydrogen, follow these shutdown guidelines:

1. **Register Threads**: Always register threads with the appropriate service thread pool.

2. **Check Shutdown Flags**: Regularly check relevant shutdown flags in thread loops.

3. **Support Condition Variables**: Wait on the appropriate condition variable with timeout.

4. **Two-Phase Resource Cleanup**:
   - First phase: Signal intent to shut down
   - Second phase: Actual resource cleanup

5. **Handle Timeouts**: Implement fallback mechanisms for timeout scenarios.

6. **Verify Resource Release**: Confirm that all resources are properly released.

7. **Document Shutdown Behavior**: Add shutdown details to component documentation.

## Troubleshooting Shutdown Issues

Common shutdown issues and solutions:

1. **Hung Threads**:
   - Check for infinite loops missing shutdown flag checks
   - Look for blocking I/O operations without timeout
   - Verify proper mutex unlock in all code paths

2. **Resource Leaks**:
   - Use `valgrind` to identify memory leaks
   - Check for unclosed file descriptors with `lsof`
   - Monitor socket states with `ss` or `netstat`

3. **Race Conditions**:
   - Add diagnostic logging to identify sequence issues
   - Increase delays between shutdown phases for debugging
   - Use thread sanitizers to detect race conditions

4. **Driver Integration Issues**:
   - Hardware drivers may need special shutdown handling
   - Check for device-specific cleanup requirements

## Subsystem Registry Integration

The Subsystem Registry plays a crucial role in the shutdown process by managing dependencies and coordinating the shutdown sequence:

1. **Dependency-Aware Termination**:
   - Subsystems are shut down in reverse dependency order
   - The registry prevents termination of subsystems that others depend on
   - Ensures all dependent subsystems are stopped before their dependencies

2. **State Tracking**:
   - Registry maintains real-time state information for all subsystems
   - Each subsystem transitions through states: RUNNING → STOPPING → INACTIVE
   - State transitions are logged and timestamped for diagnostics

3. **Centralized Shutdown Control**:
   - `update_subsystem_registry_on_shutdown()` coordinates shutdown of all registered subsystems
   - Registry ensures all subsystems receive shutdown signals
   - Verifies all subsystems have terminated properly

4. **Shutdown Sequence Management**:
   - Registry maintains a consistent shutdown order based on dependencies
   - Components with no dependents are stopped first
   - Core systems with many dependents are stopped last

The registry provides real-time monitoring of the shutdown progress, allowing the main shutdown sequence to adapt to conditions and ensure all subsystems are properly terminated.
