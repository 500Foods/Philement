4. **Architecture Suggestions**: AI recommendations for system architecture and design patterns

## AI-Oriented Commenting Practices

An important aspect of working with AI in development is writing code and documentation that effectively guides AI tools. Well-crafted comments can dramatically improve how AI understands, interprets, and assists with your codebase.

### Why Write AI-Friendly Comments

1. **Enhanced Understanding**: AI systems benefit from explicit context and explanations that might be implicit for human developers
2. **Improved Suggestions**: Better comments lead to more accurate and relevant code suggestions from AI assistants
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Detailed comments help AI understand institutional knowledge and project-specific conventions
4. **Reduced Misinterpretations**: Clear guidance reduces the likelihood of AI misunderstanding code intent or architecture
5. **Accelerated Onboarding**: New team members using AI tools can understand the codebase more quickly

### Comment Types and Best Practices

#### Function and Method Comments

For functions and methods, include:

- Purpose and responsibility of the function
- Parameter descriptions and expected types
- Return value description
- Error handling behavior
- Usage examples for complex functions

```c
/**
 * @brief Processes incoming WebSocket messages and routes them to appropriate handlers
 * 
 * @param context The WebSocket context containing connection information
 * @param message The raw message data received from the client
 * @param length Length of the message in bytes
 * 
 * @returns 0 on success, negative error code on failure
 * 
 * @note AI-guidance: This function is part of the message processing pipeline 
 * and should maintain thread safety when accessing the context structure.
 * Any modifications should preserve the existing error handling pattern.
 */
int websocket_process_message(ws_context_t *context, const char *message, size_t length) {
    // Implementation...
}
```

#### Architectural Comments

For complex systems or components:

- Description of the component's role in the system
- Interaction patterns with other components
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Performance considerations

```c
/* 
 * Print Queue Manager Architecture
 * -------------------------------
 * 
 * AI-guidance: This module implements a thread-safe print job queue system with the following design principles:
 * 
 * 1. Non-blocking queue operations for high-concurrency scenarios
 * 2. Two-phase commit pattern for job status changes to prevent data corruption
 * 3. Periodic persistence to survive unexpected shutdowns
 * 
 * The core data structures use a linked list implementation optimized for quick insertion
 * rather than lookup, as the primary operation pattern is FIFO with rare random access.
 */
```

#### Inline Explanation Comments

For complex algorithms or non-obvious implementations:

- Explanation of the approach or algorithm
- References to relevant papers or resources
- Performance characteristics
- Edge case handling

```c
// AI-guidance: This search uses an optimized Boyer-Moore implementation
// with the following modifications for our specific use case:
// 1. Pre-computed skip table for common G-code patterns
// 2. Early termination checks to handle our specific input format
// 3. Thread-local caching of intermediate results for repeated searches
//
// Reference: https://example.com/modified-boyer-moore-paper
while (search_position < end_position) {
    // Search implementation...
}
```

#### TODO and FIXME Comments with Context

When marking areas for future work:

- Clear description of what needs to be done
- Explanation of why it's needed
- Any requirements or constraints for the solution
- Links to relevant issues or documentation

```c
// TODO(AI-guidance): Replace this manual JSON parsing with jansson library calls
// when updating this module. The current implementation doesn't properly handle
// escape sequences in strings, which could lead to parsing failures with certain
// input patterns. See issue #342 and the JSON parsing standards document.
```

### Markdown in Documentation Files

When writing markdown documentation:

- Use consistent heading levels for proper document structure
- Include code blocks with language specifiers for proper syntax highlighting
- Use tables for structured data
- Add anchor links for easy reference

Example of effective markdown for AI understanding:

```markdown
# Component Overview

## Message Handling System

The message handling system processes all WebSocket communications using a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Authentication** - Verifies user credentials and session tokens
2. **Parsing** - Converts raw messages into structured data objects
3. **Validation** - Ensures the message meets the required schema
4. **Processing** - Executes the requested action
5. **Response Generation** - Creates appropriate response messages

### Key Classes and Functions

| Name | Purpose | Thread Safety |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `MessageParser` | Converts raw JSON to message objects | Thread-safe |
| `ActionRouter` | Maps message types to handler functions | Read-only after init |
| `ResponseBuilder` | Creates standardized response payloads | Requires external locking |

<!-- AI-guidance: When extending this system, maintain the pipeline architecture 
and ensure all new message types follow the validation pattern established in 
the MessageValidator class. -->

```

### Using Special Comments for AI Guidance

You can use special comment markers that are specifically intended for AI tools:

```c
/* AI:IGNORE_START */
// Legacy code that should be preserved but not referenced by AI tools
/* AI:IGNORE_END */

/* AI:IMPORTANT This section implements a critical security feature.
   All modifications must preserve the input validation sequence and 
   maintain the defense-in-depth approach. */

// AI:REFACTOR_CANDIDATE This function has grown too complex and should be
// split into smaller, more focused functions in a future update.
```

### Best Practices Summary

1. **Be Explicit** - Avoid assuming implicit knowledge; state the obvious if it helps AI understanding
2. **Provide Context** - Explain why code is written a certain way, not just what it does
3. **Use Consistent Formats** - Adopt a consistent commenting style throughout the codebase
4. **Update Comments** - Keep comments synchronized with code changes
5. **Link Related Components** - Reference related parts of the system to help AI build a mental model
6. **Include Examples** - Demonstrate usage patterns where appropriate
7. **Highlight Constraints** - Explicitly note performance requirements, thread safety concerns, etc.

By following these practices, you'll create a codebase that works more effectively with AI development tools, leading to better suggestions, fewer misunderstandings, and a more productive development process.
