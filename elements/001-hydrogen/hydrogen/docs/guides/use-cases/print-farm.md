# Small Print Farm Setup

This guide describes how to set up and manage Hydrogen in a small print farm environment with multiple 3D printers.

## Typical Environment

- Multiple 3D printers (2-10 units)
- Dedicated network segment
- Continuous operation requirements
- Load balancing needs
- Central monitoring station

## Architecture Overview

```text
[Load Balancer] --> [Hydrogen Server 1] --> [Printer 1]
                --> [Hydrogen Server 2] --> [Printer 2]
                --> [Hydrogen Server N] --> [Printer N]
```

## Setup Components

1. **Individual Printer Nodes**

   ```json
   {
       "ServerName": "printer-01",
       "WebServer": {
           "Port": 5000,
           "EnableIPv6": true
       },
       "PrintQueue": {
           "Enabled": true
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Load Balancer Configuration**

   ```apache
   <Proxy balancer://printercluster>
       BalancerMember http://printer-01:5000
       BalancerMember http://printer-02:5000
       ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
   </Proxy>
   ```

3. **Health Monitoring**

   ```bash
   # Health check endpoint
   curl http://printer-01:5000/api/system/health
   ```

## Management Strategies

### Job Distribution

- Automatic load balancing
- Priority queue management
- Resource allocation

### Monitoring

- Centralized dashboard
- Status aggregation
- Alert system

### Maintenance

- Rolling updates
- Backup rotation
- Log aggregation

## Common Workflows

### Print Job Submission

1. Submit to load balancer
2. Automatic printer selection
3. Job execution
4. Status monitoring

### Resource Management

1. Material tracking
2. Printer availability
3. Queue optimization
4. Capacity planning

## Best Practices

1. **Network Setup**
   - Dedicated VLAN
   - Static IP assignments
   - Redundant connections

2. **Security**
   - Access control
   - Network isolation
   - Monitoring systems

3. **Operations**
   - Regular maintenance schedule
   - Backup procedures
   - Update strategy

## Advanced Topics

1. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Adding new printers
   - Load balancer configuration
   - Network capacity

2. **Automation**
   - Job scheduling
   - Material management
   - Maintenance alerts

3. **Integration**
   - ERP systems
   - Inventory management
   - Quality control
