## Summary

Today's changes implemented runtime configuration validation using JSON Schema during Hydrogen app startup, ensuring config files are validated against the schema when provided. The validation is informational and does not prevent app startup. Additionally, continued development of the auth service with new API modules and updated planning documents.
