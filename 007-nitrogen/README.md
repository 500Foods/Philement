While Lithium is the primary UI, there's an interest in additional UIs. Maybe for display-only, but likely UIs that we can interact with.

## Brainstorming
- Replacement for KlipperScreen. Lots of room for improvement!
- Angling for something like Knomi, or maybe even support for Knomi.
- A "clapperboard" interface - a small touch display with current printer statistics. Like Knomi but 4-inch display.
- This device can also be equipped with sensors, particularly a VOC sensor.
- Another one can be placed on your desk.
- A set can be used to monitor a print farm.
- Adafruit/Feather/WiFi/Can bus/Arduino project is the current thought process.
- Use the same tooling for the MMU project.
- An actual product that could be made for sale.
- Maybe develop production version rather than the Adafruit feather implementation.
- RP2040.
