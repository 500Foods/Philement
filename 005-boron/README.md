Lots of 3D printers are available now, and lots of other machines, like CNC machines and robots, might be worthwhile integrating with. Initially, this is intended to be a repository of information, making it easier to setup a system using those printers or other hardware. 

## Brainstorming
- JSON everywhere.
- Object view of each printer, including its components.
- EG: Troodon > CoreXY > Z Motors > Z3 Motor
- Eg: Troodon > Klipper.
- Eg: Troodon > CoreXY > Gantry > Toolhead > Stealthburner > Ceramic Hotend > P1000 Sensor.
- Should provide enough detail for anything that can be configured, logged, sensed, and so on.
- Make it easy to swap around parts for those that have made changes.
- Make it easy to share this information with anyone who is interested.
- Consider carefully how this information is controlled.
- Access entirely through Lithium UI.
- Online resource, naturally, able to download relevant configurations.
- Ability to link to other resources. "Living" version of WelcomeToTroodon.
